### Scriptlighter's Duel

A traditional method of settling disputes and matters of honor between scriptlighters or those honored by scriptlighters. Each begins by taking control of a nearby object, and discarding any pre-prepared engrams or weapons, instead each receiving identical gimyns. If the duelers are of differing resonant capacity, the ability of the lower is matched. The duel begins with fighters equidistant inside a boundary ring, and ends when either all their objects are taken or they are pushed outside the ring by a coupled object. Any bodily contact is strictly forbidden, and all interaction must be done through coupling, combustion, and–if possible–spontaneous engrams.  

Due to the limitations of the duel, it often resembles modern boxing. The rock is held close to the chest to defend against coupling challenges, but must be risked in order to attack. The most important skills are thus spacing, controlled combustion, and the ability to maintain multiple couplings.  

The game has varying names, and is thought to have originated in south-west Anndalor during the Wanderflame Era and spread through trade routes and legends. It’s called a stone-swing in the Jïumannian Halanian dialect, an orbiton in Jinzu, and a spin-duel in Ayangatalan.  

The game itself can have additional rules, such as allowing or encouraging bodily harm, adding orbiters for difficulty, or restricting movement.  

For any duel between two scriptlighters, there are a few common principles which govern the flow of the fight.

1. The further your weapon is from yourself, the more difficult it is to control, and the easier an opponent can capture it.  
2. If two coupled objects collide at speed, a small-scale combustion will trigger: the less massive weapon will be decoupled, and the other weapon will be proportionately drained and stunned according to the similarity of their energy densities. The intensity of this collision also depends on the impact velocity, with lesser velocities shaking loose less couple.  
3. Coupling conserves the momentum of the coupler-coupled system, so moving opposite to heavy weapons ensures efficiency.  
4. If a sufficiently high-flashpoint weapon is thrown at high speed, there is little time to usurp a coupling, and a hit or non-capture miss is likely.  
5. If a weapon is dodged, it can be quickly captured unless it is infused (impossible) or soulforged (delayed for too long).

### Matrimonial Anthrakimy

A Jïumannian tradition that eventually spread worldwide, it is the practice of using decorative flamescript and precise melding to craft a gem for one’s partner to be embedded in some piece of jewelry or ornamental weaponry. As the practice of proper anthrakimy is extremely taxing and complicated, it is seen as a beautiful show of dedication and effort, as well as investment.
### Jinzu Numeral System

A base-12 numerical system made ubiquitous by the Jinzuhai Empire during the period of their mercantile domination, formed on base 12 due to their 6-fingered hands. The glyphs are ordered in groups of three, from 0 to 11. 0 is a bar tilted ~45 degrees, 1 is a straight bar, and 2 is a bar tilted 45 degrees. 3, 4, and 5 are identical, with a bar attached to the bottom. 6, 7, and 8 move this bar to the middle, and 9, 10 and 11 attach it to the top. Read from left to right, a long detached horizontal bar is placed over any number sequence to indicate the correct orientation, as the glyphs are all radially symmetrical. The glyphs are:

## Bergheim

### Main Fixations

The culture of Bergheim is centered largely around meritocracy, apprenticeship, and family units. These three concepts pervade almost every aspect of Bergian culture, from manners to marriage.

### The Nine Disciplines

Meritocracy in Bergheim is largely represented by the Nine Disciplines, the largest guilds of the most respected professions. These professions each elect their leaders by annual relevant tournaments, and the leader is responsible for governing their respective sector under the supervision of the king.  
Most notably, the monarch and rulership are treated as the 0th discipline, and in addition to primogeniture a prospective monarch must pass the King’s Gauntlet. Technically, any citizen of Bergeim can challenge the current monarch and seize the throne by claiming victory. The royal succession then uses them as a zero point and continues until the next disruption. However, the consequences of failing are complete banishment, and so no family in recent history has challenged house von Weiss.  
Most well-known among the Nine Disciplines is the craft of kindlegems. In addition there is gimyndine engineering, artifice, gimyndine mining, and scriptcraft. The remaining mundane four are agriculture, military, artistry, and study.

## Roseine

### Leaf-blade Combat

A common style of combat within the Roseine Forest, which relies on the titular leaf-blade, a leaf-shaped dagger with a groove intended for a Leaudoré’s toxin. This is largely due to swords and other long slashing or spinning weapons having been viewed as impractical tools of war in the dense undergrowth, save for stabbing spears.

## Eldwyth Tribes

### Marriage Procedures

Marriage, referred to as “ymonir” (joining) in Eldwyn is the name for a ritual procedure which recognizes two tribe members as mutually exclusive, and partially interlinks their souls. The ritual is regarded as having a high degree of spiritual importance due to the significant increase in soulfire a well-matched linked couple can produce, and the consequences of forcing a bad pairing.  
For the ritual itself, it is traditional for both partners to wear long, flowing clothes dyed in the gold and green shades of the holy Pelygwyr flower, in the hopes of borrowing on its power for a successful linkage.  
Marriage is allowed between all, but it is highly expected that your partner be of the same soulfire color, and to a lesser degree the opposite sex.

### Rhodiaeth Dann

A week-long holiday similar to Christmas, held during the 4th week of Emron and centered around giving gifts to loved ones and potential lovers. Also the day when priests end their service by approaching Rhoddyn-Gwyd, as the holiday is celebrated in appreciation of Emrall’s gift of life to the forest.

### Clothing

Of the dyes available to the Kaithurhi natively in Kanthyna: red, blue, cyan, violet, and emerald see the most use. Of these colors, **red** is seen as a more feminine color and **blue** as masculine. **Cyan** is a neutral color, seen as the color of working, farming, and life. **Violet** is seen as a valorous color, typically worn by warriors and great hunters. **Emerald** is seen as a holy color, only being sourced from certain weeds that grow around Pelygwyrs, and only worn by priests. Those with the very rare emerald eyes or emerald soulfire are seen as angelic incarnations or prophets.  
For the Kaithurhi, the mid-stomach is considered one of the most intimate areas of the body. Thus all clothing for even the servant/farming class covers at least the lower abdomen, with almost as much fervor as the groin.

### Gender Roles

Eldwyth society recognizes 3 principle genders. Male, female, and the hermaphroditic *sancyffo*. Each of these genders are expected to portray certain traits, and gravitate towards certain jobs.   
However, the Eldwyth place a much higher emphasis on the color of one’s soulfire in determining roles and jobs. For example, a woman born with **violet** soulfire will be expected to join the hunting corps and be more brave and honorous. Meanwhile, a man born with **red** soulfire will be expected to be calmer, take up swordplay, and a feminine profession such as farming or sewing.  
“Masculinity” to the Eldwyth is embodied by a mix of traditional masculinity and emotionality. Men are expected to be emotionally free and open, living in the moment and discussing their feelings frequently. Masculine hobbies include most sports and games, archery, and bow-making. Masculine jobs are often to hunt, to fight, and to build.  
“Femininity” to the Eldwyth is embodied by stoicism, mindfulness, and independence. Women are expected to show little emotion besides love, and especially to show no dependence. They are expected to be to each their own, and to only open their hearts to one man, and only then in moderation. Feminine hobbies include swordplay, puzzles, sewing, and botany. Feminine jobs include farming, war counseling, and writing.  
Finally, there is the matter of the *sancyffo*. This gender is relatively uncommon, and only those with Emerald soulfire or particularly androgynous traits are expected to portray its virtues. The *sancyffo* are expected to be holy, wise, and mysterious. In fact, for a sancyffo to reveal their sex is considered highly embarrassing and grotesque. They are almost exclusively priests and wanderers, living in harmony with the forest and guiding others they come across.

### Soulfire Color

The Kaithurhi attach the soulfire color of one’s bacterial resonance to certain personality traits, with some colors even being prerequisites for certain social ranks or jobs.   
For example, those with an **emerald** soulfire are seen as spiritual, philosophical, holy, and kind; and are the only ones who can work as priests.   
Those with **violet** soulfire are seen as brave, stubborn, heroic, and honorous. They are commonly found in hunting groups or the rare dedicated military, although it is not a prerequisite.  
Those with **magenta** soulfire are curious, inquisitive, and independent. They typically find themselves in positions of shimmer-beast hunters, scholarship, or living as a wandering *coedwyn*.  
Those with **rose** soulfire are amiable, good arbitrators, and sometimes two-faced. Most often they are politicians, revolutionaries, and public figures. Some even force a harmony with emerald bacteria, with the Kaithurhi unable to see their true color for lack of spark vision.  
Those with **red** or **blue** soulfire are seen as more embodying the traits of that particular gender. Blue are seen as good swordswomen, seamstresses, and farmers, while red are seen as excellent hunters, passionate, and leaders.  
Those with **golden** soulfire are seen as creative, emotional, and excitable. They also typically have a greater connection to soulfire and the wandersouls, 2nd only to **Emerald** soulfire. Often join the **magentas** as *coedywn*, or find work as painters or other artists.  
Those with **orange** soulfire are seen as self-sacrificial, cooperative, and friendly. They are often assistants to higher color castes in all positions. They also make up a significant chunk of the main workforce in menial tasks, like planting seeds and guarding wagons. 3rd most common after red and blue.  
Those with **cyan** soulfire are seen as loyal, proud, and very tribal. They are often local leaders of businesses, expeditions, and other small-scale community operations.  
Those with **lime** soulfire are seen as peaceful, easygoing, and friendly. They will most often be foragers, shopkeepers, and animal-keepers.

### Tanóyryddaeth

A Kaithurhi martial art that was designed as a last method of defense in war when one’s spear or bow was lost. It focuses mainly on defensive techniques to assist in escape, but also incorporates paralyzing blows through the use of electric shocks.

## Muintaferan

### Hair Sharing

A customary practice among the Muintaferan is to wear a locket of your lover’s hair with your own as an extension. This tradition has also extended recently into the Jïumannian nobility as a novel fashion trend, especially among the Áren.

### Trelamach

A common way of life among the particularly devout or holy Muintafer that involves forfeiting most personal desires and possessions in service of a code. Specifically, the Trelamach code, which is as follows:

1. Cause no harm  
2. Assist in good  
3. All else is secondary

In practice this means that many Muintafer will attach themselves to whoever they believe is doing the most good, or those who they believe to be heroic. They will also do most anything that is ordered of them by this person, except for causing harm, even in the name of good.

### Sleghadachd Tshaighcrú

   The spear art of the Muintaferan.

### Saighonar Tshaighcrú

   The bow art of the Munitaferan.

### Fergeámor Tshaighcrú

   The claymore (lit. “grass cutter”) art of the Muintaferan.

### Four Estates

The dominant socio-political hierarchy in Arenfürich, composed of four social classes separated by distinct titles and clan names. This includes the indentured, the experienced, the arteries, and the lords. Each class is identified by their title, surname, or both. There is also a fifth class, the nameless, who belong to no city and wander the wild forest, though due to their nature they are typically disregarded.

Those without last names have a strange reputation, being equally disliked for their disloyalty and feared for their ability to survive alone outside the cities. Many are often disgraced Arteries or lucky village survivors, and these two stereotypes compete to dominate the Nameless’ cultural perception. They are, however, universally regarded as outsiders.

### The Whetstone

A yearly tradition for the Áren Bearer Corps, where they participate in public competition within the Nichtfryth Colosseum. The arena itself is filled with a tension net of coupled blacksteel anchor points, which progressively get denser towards the center, converging on a floating platform. The colosseum itself is large enough to house 5 on 5 conflicts, a match-up considered full-scale for [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]].

The event is intended to act as training for the Bearer Corp in times of peace, while also serving to generate support from the public and boost recruitment. Each of the returning fighters will often purposely embrace their gimyndine's Shade–as opposed to repressing it–in a manner similar to theater performances. This technique has since been proven to advance the ego death of gimyndine users, and is generally perceived as an archaic mistake.

Each fighter is also paired with a strategist pulled at random from the Flamescribe Companies if they lack a permanent partner, a measure intended to both encourage teamwork and help them to find one, with this particular method being the most common for [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] who did not have a Kindling (latecomers or failures). The scribe is often tasked with gear maintenance, tactics advisal, and training regimens. They are, however, intended as equals.

## Jïumannes

### Jïumannian War-coupling

A specific style of soulfire coupling practiced widely in Jïumannes, which simplifies all control into 4 basic commands. Heat–the vibrating of soulfire to heat the material; Shrink–the strengthening of soulfire bonds, condensing the material and also cooling it; Rend–the severing of soulfire bonds to cut and separate the material; and Force–the imparting of motion onto the material.

Jïumannian war-coupling in particular focuses on training in two extremes of combat archetypes: flash-cutters and behemoths. Flash cutters lean into the lightning-quick yet highly precise weapons such as the needle dart or naked bullet. Their defense largely relies on speed, with almost all of their gimynfire being dedicated to it.

Behemoths, on the other hand, are trained in the use of iron-leg skystilts and exceedingly large weapons like rock-cleavers and simple boulders; the philosophy being that with sufficient weight, their momentum cannot be negated or blocked. Maximizing this, they are trained to use two or more weapons in equidistant orbit while constantly spinning them, a nightmare for fortresses and common soldiers.

### Bond Festival

A festival held every cycle for a full 12-day week, beginning just after the weekend Rapids, and ending on the last day of the following Rapids. The festival is largely a celebration of firekeeping and Jïumannian independence.

Notably, the ceremony isn't expected to be the last chance for pairs to be made, as some inevitably fail to find partners, but those who do are looked down upon as "leftovers," and may either negotiate an off-ceremony pairing or even participate in the next one, if desperate enough.

The festival's entertainment is not limited to the Lighter's competitions, however, as the numerous townsfolk and existing flamepairs host competitions and various art performances as well. It is not uncommon for flamepairs who wish to focus on more artistic areas to be formed during one of the events, but many simply use them as a celebration of the art which represents their freedom.

One festival tradition is the Storm-runs, held on the final weekend days of the festival when the Rapids begin again. The challenge is to navigate some course through the use of skystilts and coupling, just as the Stormrunners did. The event is part of the Kindling Ceremony, as the demonstration for lightweight skystilts, but it is also held as a challenge for experienced veterans.

Perhaps the second-most popular festival tradition is the Ironblood Duels. Each local festival may hold their own, which is a simple tournament of scriptlighter duels held on an elevated platform above a steamrise. In addition to the normal victory conditions of acquiring surrender, decoupling the chestplate, or disarming your opponent, if one manages to push their opponent off the edge, that too is victory. Each match is often a maximum of 3 rounds, after which the winner advances in typical tournament fashion. The ultimate winner is often gifted something useful to their profession of war, up to and including a set of scarlet blazestones, but may also be powderblade handles, pre-forged silversteel, or a simple cash prize.

On the evening of the final day, the Kindling Ceremony is held, and the scribes present their engrams to their lighters as an offer of partnership. After the successful pairings, the new couples are celebrated with wine, drink, and games until the couples retire for a honeymoon.

### Heinitan Bracer Style

Lit. "Shock Bracer Style," a Jïumannian martial art designed by noblemen for defense against assassination, relying on the use of armored gauntlets or bracers to defend against and disarm sword-wielders. Notably, it has little method of dealing with spears, as they were deemed too simple to spend much time on.

### Baohei Armored Style

Lit. “Fortress Style,” an imported martial art from Jinzu immigrants that takes advantage of being adequately armor. In modern times, the armor is often replaced with small personal gimyndine shield generators, but the moves remain very similar. Taking advantage of the armor’s durability, strikes are often made with the forearms, heels, and shins. A notable vulnerability is the groundedness of the art, and inability to quickly shut down opponents. It performs very well against speed-oriented styles. It is a common style for heavyweight scriptlighters to learn as part of their training.

### Sengriene Sword Style

Lit. "Continuous Flow Style," a sword discipline popular among young Jïumannian noblewomen. Places emphasis on carrying momentum elegantly through strikes, and taking a holistic approach to battle. Uses many strikes of little power.
