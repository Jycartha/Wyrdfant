### Spin Friction

Similar to particle physics, the “spin” of [[Soulfire|soulfire]] refers to, in a sense, its angular momentum. Spin is imparted upon [[Infusion|infused]] soulfire through the addition of a twisting force to radial compression, and higher spin soulfire has the property of a higher “static friction” when infused. That is, it “sticks” better before an applied [[Intention Field|conscious force]] detaches it. The main limitation of many kinematic systems involving [[The Phlogistic Model|phlogistics]] is the magnitude of this spin friction, as it limits the upper bound of force that can be applied reliably, thus limiting the weight of manipulable objects.
