### Immersionists

A tradition that draws chiefly from flamescribing, and is focused entirely on firekeeping’s potential to “tell a story.” Immersionists make use of [[flamescript]] and [[Engram|engrams]] manipulating [[Soulfire]] in the emotional axes, bypassing sensory organs and presenting what amounts to an artificial experience or memory directly to the target. Practitioners range from travelling storytellers to masters of spycraft, as the same tools which paint a new reality naturally paint over the existing one, allowing for presence and image modification, while masters may even *immerse* targets in entirely false realities.
