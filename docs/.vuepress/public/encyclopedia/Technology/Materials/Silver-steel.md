### Silver-steel
A [[melded alloy]] used widely in scriptlighterâ€™s armor and weapons, known for its high coupling factor and toughness while maintaining flexibility. Taking full advantage of the unique structures allowed by melding, silver-steel is composed of a tungsten-carbide outer shell, blacksteel inter-layer, and tungsten backing. The tungsten shell helps to deflect blades and projectiles while also contributing to a high reactive combustion capacity, while the blacksteel backing provides an elastic rebound for blunt weapons and easy self-repair through melding. The tungsten is also specially soulforged to have long, linear grains, helping to displace energy. When breaking, the outer shell expanding under the swell of the blacksteel also helps to soften the impact.
