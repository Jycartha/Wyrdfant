### Crucibles

A crucible is a room-sized structure designed to completely enclose and amplify [[Gimyndine|gimynfire]] or [[Soulfire]], almost compressing it into a fluid in the air. Such an extreme environment allows for the construction of deep coupling bonds–also known as soulforging–as well as creating high-quality [[adamant]] by almost incarnating soulfire into powdered anthracite.
