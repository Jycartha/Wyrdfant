<p>The universally employed calendar system of Aliffrüme, and a relic from the Hythean Era. It contains 660 days split into a sequential summer and winter semicycle, each with 9 months of 36 days and one intercalary week; all split into weeks of 6 days. A full cycle of the calendar is called a twïchircul, in Halanian. Every 20 cycles, a leap month consisting of 13 days is added to account for drift. The months, in Halanian, are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Forma (Form-)</li>
<li>Öðer (Öte-)</li>
<li>Thridda (Thri-)</li>
<li>Feorþa (Feor-)</li>
<li>Fifta (Fit-)</li>
<li>Siexta (Siex-)</li>
<li>Seofoþa (Seof-)</li>
<li>Eiatoþa (Eia-)</li>
<li>Nijöþa (Nijö-)</li>
</ol>
<p>During the summer semicycle, Sol- is prefixed to the month's name, while during the winter, Mone- is appended.</p>
<p>The days of the week–in Halanian–are, in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Golatüimdajë</li>
<li>Sielledajë</li>
<li>Akafreydajë</li>
<li>Arbladajë</li>
<li>Gyllicadajë</li>
<li>Fürehterdajë</li>
</ol>
<p>Most commonly, the last 2 days of the week are considered days of rest, or in Halanian cultures specifically assigned to personal study. Under the following system, a complete statement of the day would be “Solötethriddes Arbladajë,” Arblad’s day of the third week of the second month of the first semester. A legal adult in most nations is 24 semicycles old, though a good number lower it to 18.</p>
