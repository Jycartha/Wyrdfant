<h3 id="radiance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#radiance"><span>Radiance</span></a></h3>
<p>A honorific used to refer to nobility, referencing their ability to use such high-quality gimyndine that when firekeeping, their hair and eyes <em>radiate</em> light.</p>
<h3 id="blicance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#blicance"><span>Blícance</span></a></h3>
<p>A honorific which roughly translates to “the quality of scintillating brilliantly, flashing varied colors.”</p>
<h3 id="twinflame" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#twinflame"><span>Twinflame</span></a></h3>
<p>A rare title used to refer to those who are capable in both scriptcraft and scriptlighting, mostly relegated to historical texts or once-in-a-generation talents. Considered a unique enough title to simply omit the bearer’s name in most circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="highscholar" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#highscholar"><span>Highscholar</span></a></h3>
<p>A title synonymous with a position of employment under the Reijëngäd as the most respected level of researcher.

<p>A widely recognized title in [[Monêfor]] and [[Halisan]], it is granted to those in possession of a scholar’s badge from a royal university. To earn a scholar’s badge, one must typically complete the highest level of program available and make some advancement deemed appropriate by the university. Shortened to Sch. in writing.</p>
