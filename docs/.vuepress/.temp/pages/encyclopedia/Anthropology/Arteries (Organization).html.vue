<p>An organization of luciant, farming monks that operates all over Halisan. Because dyed gimynfire can contaminate foodstuffs, it is very dangerous to ever mix the two, and so many societies struggle to develop farming technology that either exceptionally secures dyed gimynfire from leaking or doesn't rely on it. The Kuthj√Øuman solution to this problem, in accordance with their land-revering culture, is to have an entirely distinct caste of luciant farmers, who forswear gimyndine and train their bodies to supramortal levels in order to serve the land.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill their purpose, the Arteries practice a wide range of activities. They train in martial arts, both to discipline their bodies and to better fend off Shades encroaching on village settlements; they also train in meditation, in order to build their own soulfire and practice handling it without the assistance of
engrams.</p>
<p>Given their peculiar status, the group is treated like a social caste entirely separate from the normal hierarchy, being simultaneously valued and ignored. Mostly, common practice is to thank them for their service, and repay them by protecting their land and elsewise leaving them alone.</p>
