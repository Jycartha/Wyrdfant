<p>Sliverwatches are devices common to see bound tightly to the wrists of high-ranking [[firekeeper]] generals, and are often used to specifically identify their rank as well. In terms of construction, a sliverwatch is rather simple: a thin wafer of gimyndine is held underneath a lead-glass panel (often engraved with a low-power script to keep time) and contained within a casing of a selected heavy metal, strapped to the wrist with a band often signifying rank, though the metal and ornate-ness of the casing can also accomplish this task.</p>
<p>Sliverwatches are more than just convenient timekeeping devices, however, as they also catalyze an integral part of gimyndine firekeeping. In order to not lose a bond to a gimyn, a [[firekeeper]] must keep a portion of it close at all times, or else the connection will slowly fade. In addition, the lead-glass can also be lifted or otherwise opened, allowing access to the gimyn and the minimal fire it provides, for emergency uses.</p>
