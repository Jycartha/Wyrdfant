<p>An extremely common supplemental [[kindlegem]] to a lightweight flamebearer's [[silver-steel]] half-plate and [[Adamant|shimmercloth]]. Typically embedded somewhere safe, a slug-catcher system serves to detect incoming projectiles, throw up a localized net of gimynfire to “catch” the projectile and somehow deal with it. The most common design is to subtly alter the projectile’s path so as to not hit the target, but others may put in the energy to fully redirect the projectile or capture it.</p>
<p>Notably, this method breaks down in the extreme case that the projectile is extremely fast. However, this also means that the projectile is likely very small, and also has a very predictable trajectory. In this case, a slug-catcher will often not &quot;catch&quot; the projectile at all, and will instead selectively harden the impact area.</p>
<p>Each slug-catcher system is unique, especially depending upon how much [[Soulfire|soulfire]] can be devoted to it. A common middle ground is a detection range of around 10 meters, and a maximum projectile mass of 10 kilograms, the average weight of a cannonball.</p>
