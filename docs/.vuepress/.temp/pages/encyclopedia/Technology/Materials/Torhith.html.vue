<p>A mineral exclusively found in the steamrise caves of [[Halisan#Arenfürich|Arenfürich]], famed far and wide for the vibrant colors of light that seem trapped within. Cynics sometimes refer to the stone as “fool’s [[Gimyndine]],” as good cuts can resemble high-quality gimyns, but those capable of resonating can tell at a glance that torhith lacks the resonating properties which makes gimyndine so useful.</p>
