<p>A variety of quartz used widely by [[Flamescribe|flamescribes]] and artificers as a sort of temporary medium for work-in-process [[Engram|engrams]]. It is artificially made by carefully melding pure sand into a near-perfect crystal structure, resulting in crystals which provide a low flashpoint and lower cost, if only presenting a passable permanence.</p>
<p>Flash quartz is commonly used in the more common or disposable firekeeping tools, such as self-guiding arrows and labor tools, as well as in the implements of lower-ranked scriptlighters. Although, since most scriptlighters tend to be of a higher caste by law of supply and demand, this is rare.</p>
