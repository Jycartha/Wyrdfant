<template><div><p>Phlogistic computing is the practice of careful, deliberate control over the motions of soulfire for the purposes of computation. The structured engram responsible for abstracting such computation is referred to as a thought engine. It is sometimes thought that the human brain encodes a thought engine of some kind.

<p>Thought engines have two key advantages over mechanical computers: a lack of physical limitations like heat dissipation and signal noise, and a protean structure. This leads to many unique features, including volumetric circuitry, multiphasic memory, and true abstract simulation.</p>
<p>Given that all phlogistic computers operate based on unrestricted logic, they are capable of perfectly emulating any physical method of computing, except for true error. For example, a phlogistic computer is perfectly capable of running probabilistic algorithms that depend upon physical phenomenon, such as a common method of prime factorization.</p>
