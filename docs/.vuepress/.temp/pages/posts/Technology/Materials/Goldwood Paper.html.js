The paper was often used in the past to make archives, books which held burnt [[Flamescript]] on their pages as a primitive method of portable engrams. Due to goldsheet's astounding longevity, however, many specimens of these archives persist to this day, and provide intriguing case studies in engram optimization, as the limited size of goldsheet forced ancient flamescribes to heavily optimize their engrams.</p>\"}")
