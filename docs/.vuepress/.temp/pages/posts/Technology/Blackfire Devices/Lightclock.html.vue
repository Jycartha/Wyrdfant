<p>One of the most common devices flamescribes produce for themselves, it a two-part lantern and timekeeping device. Constructed like an hourglass, [[Gimyndine#Ashstone|gimpowder]] gradually falls down into an ongoing [[Engram]] of a warm light and gets consumed. For [[Artifice|artificers]], this is often one of the first devices they make, as a good combination of physical mechanics and flamescript. These objects thus tend to have special import to their creators, and are decorated accordingly.</p>
