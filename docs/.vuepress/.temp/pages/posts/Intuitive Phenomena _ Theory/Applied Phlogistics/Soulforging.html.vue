<p>The lesser-known assistant to many flamepairs, soulsmiths are those who make use of infusion and its techniques to craft tools and weapons with their bare hands. In addition to convenience–especially in environments disagreeable to fire, like Arenfürich or the Tohneasian Mist-forests–the process of using gimynfire during the forging process gives the product a higher tolerance for [[infusion]] and a smoother response to manipulation. The process also allows for precise melding and rending, facilitating complex alloys and intricate shapes.</p>
