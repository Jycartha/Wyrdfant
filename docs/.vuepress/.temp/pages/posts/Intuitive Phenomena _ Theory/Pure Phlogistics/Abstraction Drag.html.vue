<p>On the construction of engrams, the chief element in the required amount of soulfire is how exhaustive the engram's &quot;description&quot; is. If, for example, one engram called simply for &quot;heat&quot; while another called for &quot;the air molecules nearest the user's hand to thermally vibrate,&quot; the second would cost much less soulfire, in exchange for being more taxing to execute. Such verbosity is naturally harder to maintain a picture of, and the ability to carefully abstract and delineate engrams is a major component of a flamescribe's skill.  This decrease in efficiency based on logical inconsistencies or blanks is referred to as abstraction drag, and is thought to hint at the nature of soulfire. That is, it serves to bridge the gap between logic and desire: the smaller the gap, the less you need.</p>
