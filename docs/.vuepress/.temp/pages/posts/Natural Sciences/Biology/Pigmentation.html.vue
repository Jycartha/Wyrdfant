<p>There are two main methods of protecting against sparks: Reflection by a lattice of guanine and collagen, or absorption by anthocyanins.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Guanine</strong> - Present in spark sensing organs, the hair and fur of many fauna, and [[Consciousness#Schausen|Schausen]] skin. Can be many colors, but most often is a glittering white.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anthocyanins</strong> - Present as hair pigmentation in many lifeforms, often as some shade of purple for better camouflage among the leaves of bacteriorhodopsin-dyed purple plants. Also serves to protect the brain from pixies, psychedelic hallucinations caused by sparks that can cause long-term mental damage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NOTE</strong> - Astaxanthin is proven to be a lipid-soluble pigment, can be blue and red to make purple. Anthocyanin is preferable because it is single-compound and easily available, but not proven uptakeable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Photosynthetic</strong> - Bacteriorhodopsin (a purple photosynthetic) is the main photosynthesis system on</p>
</li>
</ul>
