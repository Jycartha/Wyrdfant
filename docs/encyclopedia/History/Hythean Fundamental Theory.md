# Hythean Fundamental Theory

What follows is the last-known theories of the [[The Hythean Empire|Hythean]] scientific diaspora at large, and is largely unsubstantiated, but simultaneously not disproven. The nature of the theory leaves it somewhat unprovable with current technology, and more akin to theology.

## Küranna's Theory of Data

An antiquated combined theory of physics and [[The Phlogistic Model|intuitive phenomena]] developed by [[Küranna of Palkûaka|Hythean Truthseeker Küranna]] regarding the underlying nature of intuitive phenomena, describing the universe as being composed of three fundamental data: Qualia, Axiom, and Substance. Reality is described and processed through Axioms, granted form and motion through Substance, and finally perceived through Qualia.  

The three elementary aspects of firekeeping–scriptlighting, flowfiring, and coupling–each are manipulations of these three fundamental data for paracausal purposes. Each uses a unique energy drawn from a unique layer of existence, and each can more easily achieve certain effects than the others.  

In modern times, this theory has been disproven by the existence and structure of the Conscious Plane, though parts of it remain helpful in the conceptualization of engrams. It is also hypothesized that rather than being inaccurate, the theory more accurately described the universe’s structure *before* the Folly of Küranna, given that the Hytheans produced highly advanced technology based on the theory. Thus some believe cosmology somehow collapsed into its modern presentation as a result of this event. The idea that foundational cosmology could shift without something deeper remaining constant is naturally unpopular, and so the current goal of proponents of this theory is to discover that underlying system, rather than accepting the Conscious Plane model as the most accurate to date.

### Qualia

The energy of sensation, imagination, and creative mental processes, contained within the Conscious Field. Beings composed of pure qualia are called Souls; their duty being to tend to the Fields of the Oversoul until they are incarnated. Qualia is further split into 4 categories:

* **Self** \- Qualia of self-reflectance, paired with Ecstacy and Grief.  
  * **Other** \- Qualia of an outside individual, paired with Admiration and Loathing.  
  * **Group** \- Qualia of a community, paired with Anticipation and Anger.  
  * **Condition** \- Qualia of a concept, paired with Fear and Surprise.

### Axioms

Referred to as abyssine, it is the structure of knowledge, calculation, and logic, drawn from the Ocean of Nous. Beings made of axioms are called Ideals, who swim and compete in the Seas of Reason. Axioms can be further divided into:  
  * **True** \- A true statement  
  * **False** \- A false statement  
  * **Unknowable** \- A statement which can’t be proven  
  * **Paradox** \- A statement which contradicts itself  
Those who are skilled in the generation and utilization of axioms are called Truthseekers, and they are renowned for the abilities of foresight, deduction, and information processing.

### Substance

The energy of existence, form, and history, siphoned from the World Pillars. Beings of vistone are called Elementals, who mine the Pillars for Vistone and build new constructs to the specifications of Axioms. All forms of vistone can be categorized into:   
  * **Crystal** \- An orderly structure, bound in a rigid and repeating pattern.  
  * **Fluid** \- A connected structure, bound with elastic links capable of breaking to change shape.  
  * **Ion** \- An isolated structure unable to form physical bonds, typically of a high energy.  
  * **Radiation** \- An ephemeral structure, unable to form bonds of any kind and easily absorbed by other structures.  
Those who are skilled in the manipulation of vistone are referred to as Architects, known for their ability to create and destroy matter nearly effortlessly. Vistone itself resembles a sort of iridescent mica, constantly shifting in pattern as if it is physically incapable of remaining still. An ironic property, considering its ties to history.
## The Self
### Soulfire Core
### Abyssine Mind
### Vistone Body
    
## World Pillars
### Grand Pillars
The supporting pillars of all the sections of the quilted universe, seeming to resemble pyramids that continually get smaller as the origin is approached, yet never seem to get any less infinite. They are in the same pit as the archives temporal, but are distinguished by their noticeably grander size. Much like the archives temporal, they *can* be entered, although doing so is generally ill-advised. Given that the singular archives can cause stress even for natural-born elementals, the archives of whole universes induce a total lysis of the vistone body, resulting in effective banishment from the world pillars or even death, if the body is all there is.
### Archives Temporal

A large area resembling a bottomless cavern filled with massive pillars of constantly shifting, ringed sedimentary vistone. Each pillar chronicles the history of everything from objects to concepts and ideas. In their base form, each pillar is responsible for the history of a singular particle, which needless to say is quite inconvenient. Thankfully, the pillars are capable of merging and connecting as if they were being melded, forming into the histories of larger conglomerate objects. The method for doing this is something known only to the Archivists, a title used to refer to both Elementals–who know it by instinct–and certain groups of sapients–who learn it through practice.  

The structure of each pillar is similar to a tower library, and is entered by walking directly through the vistone. Upon entering the vistone, the archivist is flooded with information in raw form gathered since the beginning of time. This can stun those off their guard, or even drive the unprepared mad. A skilled archivist will bend the stone around them, navigating through the record like scrolling through a vinyl. The experience is said to be quite surreal and oddly calming, as if one is being comforted by knowledge.
### Entropic Mines

An area of the world pillars where new vistone is mined and exported to the various archives and worlds. Unlike the archives, the mines resemble a system of caverns filled with the rhythmic pounding of vistone being wrenched from the walls by elementals. The network is constantly shifting as the various tunnels are shortened and reconnected periodically to keep transportation simple. The vistone is carried through the tunnels by train-like elementals that seem to skim and slide along the ceiling, eventually digging through at some predetermined point to their destination.
## Ocean of Nous
### Engram of Engrams
### Forest of Unending Minds
### Sea of Sparks
### Memetic Reef
## Fields of the Oversoul
### Greater Conscious Field

The hypothesized final destination of drifting souls, and the logical conclusion of an observed paradox. Though with death, souls lose their conscious skin and begin drifting at the whim of the currents, they remain impervious to damage and tend to stay bound to the planet. However, there is not an ocean of every soul from all history covering the surface. Thus, the souls must be going somewhere.
