## Arteries

An organization of luciant, farming monks that operates all over Halisan. Because dyed gimynfire can contaminate foodstuffs, it is very dangerous to ever mix the two, and so many societies struggle to develop farming technology that either exceptionally secures dyed gimynfire from leaking or doesn't rely on it. The Kuthjïuman solution to this problem, in accordance with their land-revering culture, is to have an entirely distinct caste of luciant farmers, who forswear gimyndine and train their bodies to supramortal levels in order to serve the land.   

In order to fulfill their purpose, the Arteries practice a wide range of activities. They train in martial arts, both to discipline their bodies and to better fend off Shades encroaching on village settlements; they also train in meditation, in order to build their own soulfire and practice handling it without the assistance of 
engrams.  

Given their peculiar status, the group is treated like a social caste entirely separate from the normal hierarchy, being simultaneously valued and ignored. Mostly, common practice is to thank them for their service, and repay them by protecting their land and elsewise leaving them alone.



### Central Calendar

The universally employed calendar system of Aliffrüme, and a relic from the Hythean Era. It contains 660 days split into a sequential summer and winter semicycle, each with 9 months of 36 days and one intercalary week; all split into weeks of 6 days. A full cycle of the calendar is called a twïchircul, in Halanian. Every 20 cycles, a leap month consisting of 13 days is added to account for drift. The months, in Halanian, are as follows:

1. Forma (Form-)  
2. Öðer (Öte-)  
3. Thridda (Thri-)  
4. Feorþa (Feor-)  
5. Fifta (Fit-)  
6. Siexta (Siex-)  
7. Seofoþa (Seof-)  
8. Eiatoþa (Eia-)  
9. Nijöþa (Nijö-)

During the summer semicycle, Sol- is prefixed to the month's name, while during the winter, Mone- is appended.

The days of the week–in Halanian–are, in order:

1. Golatüimdajë  
2. Sielledajë  
3. Akafreydajë  
4. Arbladajë  
5. Gyllicadajë  
6. Fürehterdajë

Most commonly, the last 2 days of the week are considered days of rest, or in Halanian cultures specifically assigned to personal study. Under the following system, a complete statement of the day would be “Solötethriddes Arbladajë,” Arblad’s day of the third week of the second month of the first semester. A legal adult in most nations is 24 semicycles old, though a good number lower it to 18.


# Culture
## Ayangatal

### The Stoneghost Doctrine

Firekeeping within Ayangatal, and the greater area of Anndalor, is defined by the quasi-religious Stonehunter Order. A guild of [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]], the Order is divided into wraithtamers (gimynkeepers) and carvers (flamescribes). For the purposes of appeasing the lingering cultural distrust of gimyndine-wielding “demon hosts,” the carvers are assigned the duty of regulating the truly complex engrams and managing captured gimyns outside of combat. Wraithtamers, meanwhile, are allowed to exude dominance and glory in various styles of martial combat.

To provide a brief history, as scriptlighters—now preferring to call themselves stone-tamers, who hunted and bound the “demonic stones” to prevent them from falling into the hands of evildoers and force their power to be used for good—inevitably came to prominence once again, the power structure of Anndalor once again came to resemble a pyramid of firekeeping ability.

This time around, however, the stone-tamers were careful to keep themselves “bound” by religious law and purpose. Advances in gimyndine research brought about the profession of flamescribes, or “carvers” as it were. With the ability to conveniently lock the “truly dangerous” engrams of automatic shields and hails of knives behind the skills of another, a new order soon emerged.

Carvers were granted the holy duty of deeming how much force was appropriate for a stone-tamer to exert, and of handling administration affairs of normal religion. Meanwhile, their hands were kept clean of the actual devastation, securing the status quo against unhealable revolt. Behind closed doors, the two factions often split into smaller groups and struggled for local power, becoming the true cause behind many border squabbles.  

Under the order and the expectations of Ayangatalan culture, carvers are almost unilaterally women for their management duties and position out of the fight. Similarly, wraithtamers are expected to be men–or at least masculine–for their duties of combat, defense, and valor.

## Jïumannes

### Stormrunners

A major component of Aren culture, equivalent to mythological heroes. Against the stoneghost anti-firekeeping doctrine, they were notable for using firekeeping to maneuver the storms without relying on infrastructure, expelling the colonizers and making firekeeping a symbol of national pride.  
Though historically the Stormrunners were luciants, time has changed them to also be thought of as gimyndine wielders, subsequently legitimizing the practice.

### Flamescribe Etiquette 

When dealing with a prestigious position like that of the flamescribe, it is only natural that some degree of special social rules and faux pas would come to surround them. The attitudes vary between the native states and the royal states, but they are largely a sort of upper class even within the nobility, equal to and sometimes synonymous with priests, depending on the local religion’s attitudes.  

A special exception in Jïumannian social etiquette for flamescribes is in regards to the viewing of another’s flamescript. Flamescribes are the only social caste allowed to view the bare flamescript of another in full emotionality, for the purposes of research and collective knowledge. This is especially important given that flamescript deteriorates rapidly over time on the scale of records, and text descriptions of various methods are rarely sufficient.

### Beorgrad System

A unique method of distinguishing approximate social classes within Jïumannian firekeeping circles, based upon the color and prominence of metallic flecks in one’s eyes. The origins of the system are relatively simple, as the flecks tend to scatter sparks.  
The highest class is gulwen, assigned to rulers and high nobility with shining golden flecks in their irises. Golden flecks are always found in royal eyes, while also appearing in noble eyes with less frequency.  
 The next highest class is selnir, reserved for lower nobility and renowned commoners with silver flecks in their irises. If there are no golden flecks in the noble eye colors, they will have silver flecks.  
Finally, having no flecks is thought to represent no firekeeping talent, and is reserved for commoners. Of the common eye colors, a rare few are capable of displaying flecks, although the flecks aren’t highly visible unless shined upon or actively fluorescing.

### Clothing

The general clothing style in Jïumannes is a unique blend of the styles of the eastern Tiangengzhe with the native Kaithurhi and Muintaferan, mainly in colors and patterns reminiscent of their Leaudoré colonizers. The separate cultures have highly distinct blends however, on account of all the clashing forces.  
The Áren Küthjïeman of the south are notable for their unique cloak-poncho, the casul. It resembles a short poncho with a wide, deep neck to expose the Áren's rainward-covered napes and chests to the rain. Women are typically expected to obscure their chests with an undershirt, although many might prefer to forgo it, something considered slightly provocative.  
The Áren are also known for their distaste for shoes, instead preferring to keep their spiked and rubberized feet bare. This serves them well, as their specialized feet are suited to taking hold of the slick tree roots and mud which form most of the solid ground in Arenfürich. For foreigners, the Áren manufacture special boots with soles made from the gum of a common plant.

### Government

The form of Jïumannes’s government is a union, composed of 6 states and 1 federal territory. Each state traces its founding back to one of the six council members of the Stormrunners, and the region as a whole is governed by a council of six elected representatives from each of the states. However, though the states cooperate heavily, it is frequently and hotly debated whether they act as a tight federation or a loose alliance.

### Jïumannian Objectivism

The Jïumannian belief system is founded on egoism and objectivism, specifically the principles that man should act in accordance with his best interest, and morality is a social construct used to put the good of society in man’s best interest. Morality is thus considered to be something easily debated and changed in accordance with what is required, almost being synonymous with law. The common tenets are:

1. People will always act in their own best interest (homo economicus)   
2. The only fair judge is a judge of multiple peers.  
3. Morality is a social construct that must be agreed upon and enforced.  
4. The best structure for society is one which ensures every individual stands to gain from the continued existence and growth of society.  
5. The ability of the individual should be unchecked, and so too should be the ability of his peers to police him.  
6. The proper purpose of life is the pursuit of one’s own happiness.

   Moreover, a central tenet of Jïumannian philosophy is the unjust nature of privacy. Nothing is viewed as wrong enough to necessitate hiding from the public, and individuals are free to act however they wish so long as they are comfortable with being seen doing it. This laissez-faire approach to taboos is a common thread.

   Naturally, this leads to an extremely individualistic governmental philosophy, while paradoxically being extremely authoritative. The individual's will and freedom are seldom controlled or limited by the government, because instead they are limited by the omniscient eye of the public.

   This is not to say that Jïumannians are emotionally repressed, Jïumannian culture is extremely open and emotive, and being generous with information is viewed as amicable. Baths are public, doors are nonexistent, and one of the biggest taboos is allowing a secret to be discovered. To request to be alone with another is a heavily charged statement, that can be anything from a threat to an incredible display of trust and intimacy.

## Hynawyth Kaithurhi

### Government

   The Kaithurhi lack any true overarching government, and are more anarchic than anything else. The one set of overarching rules, called the “Hinanndybiaeth Code,” is more of a moral expectation than recognized law. It forbids the existence of dependent relationships outside of families, only allowing for mutualistic relationships with no power imbalance.

   This gives rise to a system wherein each “tribe” is less of a tribe than actual family units, called teipiau. These family units then enter into co-defense pacts with other units, in addition to other trade agreements. These interwoven relationships tend to group into large clusters, which are then called the tribes.

### Philosophy

   Much of the Kaithurhi’s beliefs are founded on Transcendentalist tenets, such as the importance of self-reliance and individuality and the innate goodness of man and nature. Notably, their culture is not based in individualism, which views all governance as harmful to the individual, but their government is often extremely weak and only protective.

   In Kaithurhi tribes, families are expected to feed, clothe, and perform for themselves other essential services. These families then form into defensive pacts and alliances, which constitute the actual “tribes.” Codependent relationships, such as equal trade, where both parties would be worse off if one left, are neither frowned upon nor encouraged.

   Metaphysically, the Kaithurhi see the Shadowless Dream and physical realm as part of the same dynamic process, as opposed to two separate locations. Namely, they believe them to be two separate states of mind that change one’s view of the world.

   Finally, the Kaithurhi believe that all life is an expression of Emrall, each being containing a fractal piece of his infinite soul. Thus, all life is an individual expression of a piece of Emrall, and connected yet unique. To live by and for themselves and to be appreciative of the nature that surrounds them and the Emrall inside them, that is the philosophy of the Kaithurhi.





# Languages

## Ayangatalan

### Naming Conventions

Given that Ayangatal-derived cultures are typically highly individualistic, those born into them are typically referred to by nicknames as children, with official documents using their parent’s name (of the same sex, if applicable) and an ordinal. For example, the first son of Altan, his father, would be called Altanyn Ekhleed (First of Altan). After their 12th cycle, a child is expected to choose their own given name, and referring to them by their patronymic from then on is considered rude.

## Elhwyn

  The traditional language of the Eldwyth Tribes, of a highly polysynthetic and Welsh-like character.

### Naming Conventions

Members of the tribes are granted only one name at birth, typically after one of the features of nature that can be seen nearby. This name is called the “core name,” and using it by itself to address a Kaithurhi is something incredibly intimate, and reserved only for married couples and a mother addressing her daughter. On the flip side, using only a demonym or title is considered extremely impersonal, and rude in friendly contexts.  
Before the core name is almost always a pre-name, or title, with various phonemes arranged in order to:

* 1\. Establish rank/title  
* 2\. Establish job
* 3\. Establish marital status  

A Kaithuhri’s full name (all possible prefixes and suffixes) is only ever used on legal documents, or when formally introducing oneself. Marital status is only included in casual situations where romance is involved.

# Legends

## Arenfürich

### Haléblæd and Halédevra

Considered by many to be the original legend which eventually morphed into the creation myth for sinahíganism, Haléblæd and Halédevra are the hero-names of the archetypal Áren flamepair, and an epic passed down through time as a cornerstone of Áren culture. Like many old tales passed down as intuitive theater and epic poetry, the story is largely a collection of various myths related to geological idiosyncrasies of Arenfürich itself, such as the steamrises, torhith pits, and fog-drowned lake. Some still revere them as the ancestral religion.

## Bergheim

### Eimeterin saun Rubonhart

Eimiterin saun Rubonhart was said to be a renowned blacksmith in his home town of Drestog, living happily with his flamescribe wife and making tools, weapons, and mechanical trinkets for the people. Many famous inventions are attributed to him, with even the royal family of Bergheim claiming ancestry, but perhaps one of the more famous is how he discovered the true use of gimyndine for his people.  
One day, Rubonhart was admiring a particularly beautiful specimen of gimyndine, focusing deeply on the colors and contours he could shape into a beautiful piece. He was then suddenly broken from this trance as he noticed a strange directionless, heatless fire emanating from it. He recognized the substance as the same fire people could produce themselves, used in the creation of flamescript, but he had never seen it so potent before, nor so easily bending to the will of another.   
Slowly, he began to recall the stories of the demigods of old, and how their ability to set their flamescript alight let them perform miracles. In disbelief, he quickly called his wife to burn an engram of an ethereal light into a stone, and he manipulated the strange fire into its curves. The flamescript immediately caught alight, and the very same ethereal ball contained in the engram manifested into reality.  
Realizing the potential of this discovery, he dubs the strange vapor "gimynfire," after the gimyndine stone from which it emerged. A resourceful man by nature, he quickly took to his workshop and worked with his wife to produce many prototypes of modern inventions like the scriptlighter’s spear, gimlantern, and blackfire rifle. Most of these inventions made it out to the public, but notes on a great many more are said to rest in Rubonhart’s fabled workshop hidden somewhere in the caverns.  
Of note is the fact that Rubonhart’s wife, an artist and carver with a special talent for flamescript art, burned many of the engrams Rubonhart used. This, combined with an inability to reject female [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] due to the sheer rarity of the talent, was the reason firekeeping began as unisex in Bergheim.



# Religions

## Rusacáveism

The dominant religion of Monêfor, and the originator of the Stoneghost Doctrine. A monotheistic religion, their chief idol is the Rose-thorned Knight.

## Guravyanism

The dominant religion of Anndalor, whose name means “of the three-pronged lightning.”

## Acherism

A unique folk religion native to Arenfürich, which does not believe in or venerate a forefather. Instead, it centers around exalting the World and living as a part of it, taking part in its blessings, and maintaining its health for the generations to come. Under the religion’s teachings, the World is a living, semi-sentient system of sorts, which is to be respected and cared for as opposed to directly worshiped. However, the wandersoul Raul is venerated as a sort of manifestation of the World’s gifts back to its caretakers.  
Although there is no organized worship, there are religious officials, referred to as Arteries–so named for the belief that soulfire is the “blood” of the World–whose duty is to transport blood from the Heart (conscious plane) to the Body (soil and plant life.) The Arteries organize the production and distribution of agricultural products from the Pulmonary Temples, directing the Capillaries in the harvesting and planting process, while the Arteries themselves nurture the plants.  
That being said, there are various different kinds of Arteries, not just those who assist in agriculture. The large concentration of soulfire present in the Pulmonaries leads to the birth of Shades, which can sap the life from crops and harm the general populace. It is the duty of the Cleansers, another kind of Artery, to purge these creatures so that the harvest can remain plentiful and untainted.  
Selection to be an Artery is dependent on one main factor: soulfire "wattage." This is roughly dependent on the mass of living tissue on a person, though all tissue is not equal. A secondary qualification, necessary to be an Aortic (chief of a pulmonary), is extreme proficiency with the Divine Blood technique, and subsequently good control over soulfire itself.

## Emrallism

A popular religion in Halisan that shares a common connector of Emrall, Verdant One as supreme patron, in the sense that he inspired a number of his powerful extraplanetary brethren to invest in Aliffrüme. Various sects then place emphasis on various disciples of Emrall, and the virtues they espouse. Their main holy text is the Lahrigus, structured into a preamble dictated by Emrall’s avatar on Earth, and then various volumes documenting the teachings of the disciples. The name of Emrall’s avatar varies by culture; where most Jïumannians refer to them as Halicsen of the Divine Scale, the Kaithurhi dub them Rhoddynbwyd-Segremyll-Emrallwih (Life-giver Segremyll, of Emrall), and the Muintaferan as Athagul, Father White.  
After the preamble, the text continues with a section detailing the life and teachings of each disciple, written as a sort of 3rd-person autobiography. Each section is referred to as a Brüfeior in Halanian.

### Sinathism

All is connected, all is tied. Good begets good, and evil begets evil. If none stop to give good in response to evil, when will the evil end? Thus to react on impulse is the highest evil, and the only reasonable voice in one’s head is the superego. The words of Brytho Sinath, Beastsoother.

### Uthwitism

What separates sentients from animals is knowledge, thus to gain knowledge is the most sentient act possible. Sentients lead animals because sentients know better for the animals than they could themselves. Therefore, society ought to be led by the most knowledgeable, and the chief pursuit of life is knowledge of the divine and all its creations. This was the doctrine laid out by Brytha Uthwita, Starscribe.

### Etasedism

Life is emotion, creation, and expansion. The chief pursuit of life is emotional experience, the dividing line between man and beast. Emotion inspires creation, creations inspire similar emotions in others. The best emotion will naturally win out, and the final emotion will logically be the best one that could be. Naturally, many tenets are shared with hedonism, but all are preached by Brytho Etasedon, Allfeeling.

### Ascwenism

To live is to serve and be served, to exist in the natural hierarchy. Every man and woman was born with a predetermined fate, and to discover and ensure this fate is the most noble pursuit of life. Naturally, to act against one’s Fate is considered a grave sin, and going against another’s is only acceptable if one’s own requires it. Such were the teachings of Brytha Ascwen, Autumnal Queen.

### Munyerism

To work the land and provide for the community is the highest calling of those who follow the tenets of Munyerism, the sect of Emrallism venerating Brytho Munyether, Great Cultivator. Munyether, it is said, was responsible for taming the tempests of Freatéfor and instilling a wandersoul of life into Ysthréorh valley and granting it eternal fertility. Thus Brytho Munyether, Landfather, gave unto the people. 

### Gwilism

Competition is the bread and butter of Gwilism, a sect of Emrallism which places emphasis on Brytho Gwilystor, Night-tamer as the one who tamed the northwest’s infamous fealstor grimewolves. Life’s goal is to immolate you, and yours is to purify yourself in the holy flames. Only the strongest shall prevail, and only the virtuous deserve to.

### Bwyddism

A sect that believes in Rhoddynbwyd-Segrewyll-Emrallwih as a life-angel servant of Emrall, and the one who sacrificed his energy to give life to the Kanthyna. This necessarily believes that the gimyndine statue, with hands outstretched and a gaze towards the rising suns, is Rhoddyn-Bwyd’s body.

### Regnbranism

All on Earth is transcience, except transience itself. Life is like a flowing river: each drop of water is not long for the journey, but the river remains. The meaning of life is to follow the flow and not obstruct the river as it flows towards the end, but to enjoy the journey and its turbulence. From the words of Brytha Regnbran, Rainbringer.

### Tshaighcrúism

A sect that venerates Tshaicrú Newvaful, Father Crimson as the shaper of the bloodgrass plains,  guardian of the Muintaferan, and gracious benefactor to all who dedicate their lives to justice. A rare sight in Jïumannian culture, the religion venerates fatherhood as the most noble pursuit in life, above even rulers and rainbreakers.




## Titles & Honorifics

### Radiance

A honorific used to refer to nobility, referencing their ability to use such high-quality gimyndine that when firekeeping, their hair and eyes *radiate* light.  
### Blícance

A honorific which roughly translates to “the quality of scintillating brilliantly, flashing varied colors.”  
### Twinflame

A rare title used to refer to those who are capable in both scriptcraft and scriptlighting, mostly relegated to historical texts or once-in-a-generation talents. Considered a unique enough title to simply omit the bearer’s name in most circumstances.  
### Highscholar

A title synonymous with a position of employment under the Reijëngäd as the most respected level of researcher. The title takes precedence over Flamescribe and Scriptlighter, although Blícance or Radiance may be swapped in after one has already referred to them by their proper title. Shortened to HSch.

### Scholar

A widely recognized title in [[Monêfor]] and [[Halisan]], it is granted to those in possession of a scholar’s badge from a royal university. To earn a scholar’s badge, one must typically complete the highest level of program available and make some advancement deemed appropriate by the university. Shortened to Sch. in writing.


# Traditions

## Global

### Scriptlighter's Duel

A traditional method of settling disputes and matters of honor between scriptlighters or those honored by scriptlighters. Each begins by taking control of a nearby object, and discarding any pre-prepared engrams or weapons, instead each receiving identical gimyns. If the duelers are of differing resonant capacity, the ability of the lower is matched. The duel begins with fighters equidistant inside a boundary ring, and ends when either all their objects are taken or they are pushed outside the ring by a coupled object. Any bodily contact is strictly forbidden, and all interaction must be done through coupling, combustion, and–if possible–spontaneous engrams.  

Due to the limitations of the duel, it often resembles modern boxing. The rock is held close to the chest to defend against coupling challenges, but must be risked in order to attack. The most important skills are thus spacing, controlled combustion, and the ability to maintain multiple couplings.  

The game has varying names, and is thought to have originated in south-west Anndalor during the Wanderflame Era and spread through trade routes and legends. It’s called a stone-swing in the Jïumannian Halanian dialect, an orbiton in Jinzu, and a spin-duel in Ayangatalan.  

The game itself can have additional rules, such as allowing or encouraging bodily harm, adding orbiters for difficulty, or restricting movement.  

For any duel between two scriptlighters, there are a few common principles which govern the flow of the fight.

1. The further your weapon is from yourself, the more difficult it is to control, and the easier an opponent can capture it.  
2. If two coupled objects collide at speed, a small-scale combustion will trigger: the less massive weapon will be decoupled, and the other weapon will be proportionately drained and stunned according to the similarity of their energy densities. The intensity of this collision also depends on the impact velocity, with lesser velocities shaking loose less couple.  
3. Coupling conserves the momentum of the coupler-coupled system, so moving opposite to heavy weapons ensures efficiency.  
4. If a sufficiently high-flashpoint weapon is thrown at high speed, there is little time to usurp a coupling, and a hit or non-capture miss is likely.  
5. If a weapon is dodged, it can be quickly captured unless it is infused (impossible) or soulforged (delayed for too long).

### Matrimonial Anthrakimy

A Jïumannian tradition that eventually spread worldwide, it is the practice of using decorative flamescript and precise melding to craft a gem for one’s partner to be embedded in some piece of jewelry or ornamental weaponry. As the practice of proper anthrakimy is extremely taxing and complicated, it is seen as a beautiful show of dedication and effort, as well as investment.
### Jinzu Numeral System

A base-12 numerical system made ubiquitous by the Jinzuhai Empire during the period of their mercantile domination, formed on base 12 due to their 6-fingered hands. The glyphs are ordered in groups of three, from 0 to 11. 0 is a bar tilted ~45 degrees, 1 is a straight bar, and 2 is a bar tilted 45 degrees. 3, 4, and 5 are identical, with a bar attached to the bottom. 6, 7, and 8 move this bar to the middle, and 9, 10 and 11 attach it to the top. Read from left to right, a long detached horizontal bar is placed over any number sequence to indicate the correct orientation, as the glyphs are all radially symmetrical. The glyphs are:

## Bergheim

### Main Fixations

The culture of Bergheim is centered largely around meritocracy, apprenticeship, and family units. These three concepts pervade almost every aspect of Bergian culture, from manners to marriage.

### The Nine Disciplines

Meritocracy in Bergheim is largely represented by the Nine Disciplines, the largest guilds of the most respected professions. These professions each elect their leaders by annual relevant tournaments, and the leader is responsible for governing their respective sector under the supervision of the king.  
Most notably, the monarch and rulership are treated as the 0th discipline, and in addition to primogeniture a prospective monarch must pass the King’s Gauntlet. Technically, any citizen of Bergeim can challenge the current monarch and seize the throne by claiming victory. The royal succession then uses them as a zero point and continues until the next disruption. However, the consequences of failing are complete banishment, and so no family in recent history has challenged house von Weiss.  
Most well-known among the Nine Disciplines is the craft of kindlegems. In addition there is gimyndine engineering, artifice, gimyndine mining, and scriptcraft. The remaining mundane four are agriculture, military, artistry, and study.

## Roseine

### Leaf-blade Combat

A common style of combat within the Roseine Forest, which relies on the titular leaf-blade, a leaf-shaped dagger with a groove intended for a Leaudoré’s toxin. This is largely due to swords and other long slashing or spinning weapons having been viewed as impractical tools of war in the dense undergrowth, save for stabbing spears.

## Eldwyth Tribes

### Marriage Procedures

Marriage, referred to as “ymonir” (joining) in Eldwyn is the name for a ritual procedure which recognizes two tribe members as mutually exclusive, and partially interlinks their souls. The ritual is regarded as having a high degree of spiritual importance due to the significant increase in soulfire a well-matched linked couple can produce, and the consequences of forcing a bad pairing.  
For the ritual itself, it is traditional for both partners to wear long, flowing clothes dyed in the gold and green shades of the holy Pelygwyr flower, in the hopes of borrowing on its power for a successful linkage.  
Marriage is allowed between all, but it is highly expected that your partner be of the same soulfire color, and to a lesser degree the opposite sex.

### Rhodiaeth Dann

A week-long holiday similar to Christmas, held during the 4th week of Emron and centered around giving gifts to loved ones and potential lovers. Also the day when priests end their service by approaching Rhoddyn-Gwyd, as the holiday is celebrated in appreciation of Emrall’s gift of life to the forest.

### Clothing

Of the dyes available to the Kaithurhi natively in Kanthyna: red, blue, cyan, violet, and emerald see the most use. Of these colors, **red** is seen as a more feminine color and **blue** as masculine. **Cyan** is a neutral color, seen as the color of working, farming, and life. **Violet** is seen as a valorous color, typically worn by warriors and great hunters. **Emerald** is seen as a holy color, only being sourced from certain weeds that grow around Pelygwyrs, and only worn by priests. Those with the very rare emerald eyes or emerald soulfire are seen as angelic incarnations or prophets.  
For the Kaithurhi, the mid-stomach is considered one of the most intimate areas of the body. Thus all clothing for even the servant/farming class covers at least the lower abdomen, with almost as much fervor as the groin.

### Gender Roles

Eldwyth society recognizes 3 principle genders. Male, female, and the hermaphroditic *sancyffo*. Each of these genders are expected to portray certain traits, and gravitate towards certain jobs.   
However, the Eldwyth place a much higher emphasis on the color of one’s soulfire in determining roles and jobs. For example, a woman born with **violet** soulfire will be expected to join the hunting corps and be more brave and honorous. Meanwhile, a man born with **red** soulfire will be expected to be calmer, take up swordplay, and a feminine profession such as farming or sewing.  
“Masculinity” to the Eldwyth is embodied by a mix of traditional masculinity and emotionality. Men are expected to be emotionally free and open, living in the moment and discussing their feelings frequently. Masculine hobbies include most sports and games, archery, and bow-making. Masculine jobs are often to hunt, to fight, and to build.  
“Femininity” to the Eldwyth is embodied by stoicism, mindfulness, and independence. Women are expected to show little emotion besides love, and especially to show no dependence. They are expected to be to each their own, and to only open their hearts to one man, and only then in moderation. Feminine hobbies include swordplay, puzzles, sewing, and botany. Feminine jobs include farming, war counseling, and writing.  
Finally, there is the matter of the *sancyffo*. This gender is relatively uncommon, and only those with Emerald soulfire or particularly androgynous traits are expected to portray its virtues. The *sancyffo* are expected to be holy, wise, and mysterious. In fact, for a sancyffo to reveal their sex is considered highly embarrassing and grotesque. They are almost exclusively priests and wanderers, living in harmony with the forest and guiding others they come across.

### Soulfire Color

The Kaithurhi attach the soulfire color of one’s bacterial resonance to certain personality traits, with some colors even being prerequisites for certain social ranks or jobs.   
For example, those with an **emerald** soulfire are seen as spiritual, philosophical, holy, and kind; and are the only ones who can work as priests.   
Those with **violet** soulfire are seen as brave, stubborn, heroic, and honorous. They are commonly found in hunting groups or the rare dedicated military, although it is not a prerequisite.  
Those with **magenta** soulfire are curious, inquisitive, and independent. They typically find themselves in positions of shimmer-beast hunters, scholarship, or living as a wandering *coedwyn*.  
Those with **rose** soulfire are amiable, good arbitrators, and sometimes two-faced. Most often they are politicians, revolutionaries, and public figures. Some even force a harmony with emerald bacteria, with the Kaithurhi unable to see their true color for lack of spark vision.  
Those with **red** or **blue** soulfire are seen as more embodying the traits of that particular gender. Blue are seen as good swordswomen, seamstresses, and farmers, while red are seen as excellent hunters, passionate, and leaders.  
Those with **golden** soulfire are seen as creative, emotional, and excitable. They also typically have a greater connection to soulfire and the wandersouls, 2nd only to **Emerald** soulfire. Often join the **magentas** as *coedywn*, or find work as painters or other artists.  
Those with **orange** soulfire are seen as self-sacrificial, cooperative, and friendly. They are often assistants to higher color castes in all positions. They also make up a significant chunk of the main workforce in menial tasks, like planting seeds and guarding wagons. 3rd most common after red and blue.  
Those with **cyan** soulfire are seen as loyal, proud, and very tribal. They are often local leaders of businesses, expeditions, and other small-scale community operations.  
Those with **lime** soulfire are seen as peaceful, easygoing, and friendly. They will most often be foragers, shopkeepers, and animal-keepers.

### Tanóyryddaeth

A Kaithurhi martial art that was designed as a last method of defense in war when one’s spear or bow was lost. It focuses mainly on defensive techniques to assist in escape, but also incorporates paralyzing blows through the use of electric shocks.

## Muintaferan

### Hair Sharing

A customary practice among the Muintaferan is to wear a locket of your lover’s hair with your own as an extension. This tradition has also extended recently into the Jïumannian nobility as a novel fashion trend, especially among the Áren.

### Trelamach

A common way of life among the particularly devout or holy Muintafer that involves forfeiting most personal desires and possessions in service of a code. Specifically, the Trelamach code, which is as follows:

1. Cause no harm  
2. Assist in good  
3. All else is secondary

In practice this means that many Muintafer will attach themselves to whoever they believe is doing the most good, or those who they believe to be heroic. They will also do most anything that is ordered of them by this person, except for causing harm, even in the name of good.

### Sleghadachd Tshaighcrú

   The spear art of the Muintaferan.

### Saighonar Tshaighcrú

   The bow art of the Munitaferan.

### Fergeámor Tshaighcrú

   The claymore (lit. “grass cutter”) art of the Muintaferan.

### Four Estates

The dominant socio-political hierarchy in Arenfürich, composed of four social classes separated by distinct titles and clan names. This includes the indentured, the experienced, the arteries, and the lords. Each class is identified by their title, surname, or both. There is also a fifth class, the nameless, who belong to no city and wander the wild forest, though due to their nature they are typically disregarded.

Those without last names have a strange reputation, being equally disliked for their disloyalty and feared for their ability to survive alone outside the cities. Many are often disgraced Arteries or lucky village survivors, and these two stereotypes compete to dominate the Nameless’ cultural perception. They are, however, universally regarded as outsiders.

### The Whetstone

A yearly tradition for the Áren Bearer Corps, where they participate in public competition within the Nichtfryth Colosseum. The arena itself is filled with a tension net of coupled blacksteel anchor points, which progressively get denser towards the center, converging on a floating platform. The colosseum itself is large enough to house 5 on 5 conflicts, a match-up considered full-scale for [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]].

The event is intended to act as training for the Bearer Corp in times of peace, while also serving to generate support from the public and boost recruitment. Each of the returning fighters will often purposely embrace their gimyndine's Shade–as opposed to repressing it–in a manner similar to theater performances. This technique has since been proven to advance the ego death of gimyndine users, and is generally perceived as an archaic mistake.

Each fighter is also paired with a strategist pulled at random from the Flamescribe Companies if they lack a permanent partner, a measure intended to both encourage teamwork and help them to find one, with this particular method being the most common for [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] who did not have a Kindling (latecomers or failures). The scribe is often tasked with gear maintenance, tactics advisal, and training regimens. They are, however, intended as equals.

## Jïumannes

### Jïumannian War-coupling

A specific style of soulfire coupling practiced widely in Jïumannes, which simplifies all control into 4 basic commands. Heat–the vibrating of soulfire to heat the material; Shrink–the strengthening of soulfire bonds, condensing the material and also cooling it; Rend–the severing of soulfire bonds to cut and separate the material; and Force–the imparting of motion onto the material.

Jïumannian war-coupling in particular focuses on training in two extremes of combat archetypes: flash-cutters and behemoths. Flash cutters lean into the lightning-quick yet highly precise weapons such as the needle dart or naked bullet. Their defense largely relies on speed, with almost all of their gimynfire being dedicated to it.

Behemoths, on the other hand, are trained in the use of iron-leg skystilts and exceedingly large weapons like rock-cleavers and simple boulders; the philosophy being that with sufficient weight, their momentum cannot be negated or blocked. Maximizing this, they are trained to use two or more weapons in equidistant orbit while constantly spinning them, a nightmare for fortresses and common soldiers.

### Bond Festival

A festival held every cycle for a full 12-day week, beginning just after the weekend Rapids, and ending on the last day of the following Rapids. The festival is largely a celebration of firekeeping and Jïumannian independence.

Notably, the ceremony isn't expected to be the last chance for pairs to be made, as some inevitably fail to find partners, but those who do are looked down upon as "leftovers," and may either negotiate an off-ceremony pairing or even participate in the next one, if desperate enough.

The festival's entertainment is not limited to the Lighter's competitions, however, as the numerous townsfolk and existing flamepairs host competitions and various art performances as well. It is not uncommon for flamepairs who wish to focus on more artistic areas to be formed during one of the events, but many simply use them as a celebration of the art which represents their freedom.

One festival tradition is the Storm-runs, held on the final weekend days of the festival when the Rapids begin again. The challenge is to navigate some course through the use of skystilts and coupling, just as the Stormrunners did. The event is part of the Kindling Ceremony, as the demonstration for lightweight skystilts, but it is also held as a challenge for experienced veterans.

Perhaps the second-most popular festival tradition is the Ironblood Duels. Each local festival may hold their own, which is a simple tournament of scriptlighter duels held on an elevated platform above a steamrise. In addition to the normal victory conditions of acquiring surrender, decoupling the chestplate, or disarming your opponent, if one manages to push their opponent off the edge, that too is victory. Each match is often a maximum of 3 rounds, after which the winner advances in typical tournament fashion. The ultimate winner is often gifted something useful to their profession of war, up to and including a set of scarlet blazestones, but may also be powderblade handles, pre-forged silversteel, or a simple cash prize.

On the evening of the final day, the Kindling Ceremony is held, and the scribes present their engrams to their lighters as an offer of partnership. After the successful pairings, the new couples are celebrated with wine, drink, and games until the couples retire for a honeymoon.

### Heinitan Bracer Style

Lit. "Shock Bracer Style," a Jïumannian martial art designed by noblemen for defense against assassination, relying on the use of armored gauntlets or bracers to defend against and disarm sword-wielders. Notably, it has little method of dealing with spears, as they were deemed too simple to spend much time on.

### Baohei Armored Style

Lit. “Fortress Style,” an imported martial art from Jinzu immigrants that takes advantage of being adequately armor. In modern times, the armor is often replaced with small personal gimyndine shield generators, but the moves remain very similar. Taking advantage of the armor’s durability, strikes are often made with the forearms, heels, and shins. A notable vulnerability is the groundedness of the art, and inability to quickly shut down opponents. It performs very well against speed-oriented styles. It is a common style for heavyweight scriptlighters to learn as part of their training.

### Sengriene Sword Style

Lit. "Continuous Flow Style," a sword discipline popular among young Jïumannian noblewomen. Places emphasis on carrying momentum elegantly through strikes, and taking a holistic approach to battle. Uses many strikes of little power.



# **Anndalor**

### Thundering Hills



# **Biogeography**

## Biomes

### Copperleaf Forests

A biome where gimyndine deposits have been brought up close to the surface, and into close proximity with dense life, typically tropical or temperate rainforests. The result is a biome overflowing with soulfire all aligned to one wavelength by spontaneous synchrony, which can be even more damaging than disharmonic soulfire.  
Life in these forests is often well-adapted to the use of ambient soulfire created by the gimyndine harmonics, when normally it could not create it. Plants self-sustain, animals use low-gravity jumps and mirages, and even the water sparkles an enchanting cyan.  
All plant life in the copperleaf forests is fotivorous, meaning that they utilize soulfire to drive glucose production. The pigment central to this is phycocyanin, which is typically a sapphire blue, but fluoresces white when in high soulfire concentrations.  
Due to the egregious amounts of dense soulfire given off by the pelygwyr and animarchaea population, certain rivers can become coated in a thick, glowing layer of flowing soulfire. Such rivers are called life-rivers, and are important recharging sites for nearby animal life. If one is unfortunate enough to fall completely in, they risk succumbing to the intense soulfire, inducing lysis of their bodies, like a resonant frequency destroying a glass.

### Stellar Plains

A region that covers northern Riihiya, and resembles an expansive pale-blue tundra sprinkled with the occasional lilypad-like violet tree. The region is permanently under thick snow cover, though it is not devoid of life. The snow pulses with bioluminescent extremophile algae, which use fotivorous processes to melt the snow around them for water and photosynthesize. The algae maintain a constant supply of soulfire by living in large colonies, and secreting highly nutritious and sweet compounds like sucrose and glucose. This, combined with the promise of water, attracts other life to these “snow-springs” while encouraging them to keep the algae alive.



# **Halisan**

### Hynawyll Valley

The home of the largest copperleaf forest in Halisan, Kanthyna, through which runs the exceedingly large Symywldwyth River. The river’s name, meaning “river of shifting color” in the native Eldwyn language, comes from the abundance of fotivorous algae genus *Animarchaea*. This river runs for more than a thousand miles throughout the forest, carrying pure soulfire to all the fotivorous plants and shimmer-beasts.

### Tereghda

An area just south of the Hynawyll Valley, called Dayadach (lit. “Scarlet Homeland,”) is the ethnic home of the Muintaferan and is known for it’s bloodgrass grasslands.   
The ecosystem is monopolized by a species of an extremely tall scarlet-colored fotivorous grass, which harvests soulfire with its roots from gimyndine brought close to the surface.

### Fahbrim Sea

A massive freshwater lake at the center of Halisan, which makes it look more like an atoll. The sea itself is fairly shallow, being 76 feet deep on average, and many adapt to life above and below the surface. The lake is mildly radiative, on account of some gimyndine runoff from the western mountains, and so many of the Halisan poor will irradiate themselves fishing for a good giymn to sell.

### Arenfürich

Arenfürich (lit. “Forest of Eternal Rain”) is one of the largest rainforests on Aliffrüme, and an extremely peculiar ecosystem. The forest is kept in a perpetual cycle of rainfall by Räl, Lord of the Everstorm, a powerful ambivalent wandersoul. The strength of the rain varies, but it invariably falls, and falls into deep pools called torhith pits where it’s vaporized into towering updrafts called steamclimbs, returning to the sky to fall again. Carried with the steam is reused minerals converted from the waste matter washed down into the pits by specialized bacteria, which then rains down back onto the forest to nurture further life.  
The incredible erosion of this climate, though tempered by the rain carrying minerals, highly favors large trees with deep and thick roots. These root systems form the de facto ground floor of the rainforest, carving deep canyons and caverns that the native Áren traverse with great expertise. Specific far-reaching roots are often marked with bioluminescent paint, and traversed by way of specialized firekeeping techniques (root-skaters) or carved-out waterways.  

One of the largest cities in Arenfürich–a mining town named Welatorhith–is actually situated around the Great Torhith Pit, the ultimate watershed of the Arenfürich basin. The pit is large enough to have multiple intakes, and even some infrastructure built down into it, constructed to withstand the intense heat from the steam.

A mountain range that is entirely controlled by the nation of Bergheim, and mostly populated by its capital of Drestog. Houses a monolithic Hythean-era manufacturing facility that produced various technologies, including many of the satellites present in Emrall’s Army and personal servants capable of storing soulfire.

# Global History

## Age of the Crown

### Hythean Era (13,805 AC \- 2,764 AC)

Defined by the global dominion of the Hythean Empire. Humanity used highly advanced digital technology, in addition to a majority of the population being genetically modified. During this time, Aliffrüme was called “Kal’hamaq” by the Hytheans, meaning “all-source,” with this meaning persisting in many Aliff languages. This era ended with the Great Gimyndization, which saw the spontaneous end of Hythean records and the earliest confirmed appearance of [[Pneumaphilic Materials#Gimyndine Varieties|dyed gimyndine]] samples known to date. These gimyns would gradually be broken up, buried, and scattered by the forces of time, with the most powerful gimyns being located around major gatherings of the erudite, like old underground cities or metropolises.

## Age of Twilight

### The Great Gimyndization (2,763 AT)

The event which changed humanity forever, and the first day records of dyed gimyndine are dated to. The event is believed to have been caused by a planetary-scale pulse of [[Soulfire#Gimynfire|gimynfire]] resonant with the Progenitor, killing every [[Corporeal Immortality#**Induced Eternity**|artificial ascendant]] it touched. All that remained of life on Aliffrüme was plants and animals incapable of harnessing [[The Phlogistic Model#Soulfire|soulfire]], and the lower class of hytheans which had no eternity to interfere with.

### Twilight Era (2,763 AT \- 1 AT)

A period in history where the lowborn humans who worked the factories and lived short lives in the Hythean era began to rebuild civilization, without the aid of firekeeping or the knowledge to create technology. 

Crude semi-medieval societies emerged and fell, with very few finding the power or organization necessary to maintain a lasting presence.  

## Age of First Light (0 \- 432 AL)

### Day of First Light (0 AL)

The origin point for many nations, each for separate reasons. Each reason, however, has its roots in when the local discovery of gimyndine’s use in [[The Phlogistic Model#Flamescript|scriptlighting]] took place. For some this means a legendary inventor creating marvels of technology, for others it means the appearance of royally powerful flamebearers. But curiously, all of these “first contacts” with modern firekeeping were recorded to occur within the same cycle, a fact currently explained as coincidence.

### Kindling Period (0 \- 93 AL)

In the early medieval society still inundated with fear of possibly returning to rule by those capable of scriptlighting, it took a long time for the practice to take hold. But as the stories of terrible tyrants shifted from history to legend, peoples all over the world began to once again scale the mountain of ardent light.

### Age of the Wanderflame (93 \- 394 AL)

As certain people came to realize they could control a certain degree of power, many took to becoming “wanderflames,” [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] who traveled from place to place and used their comparatively-miniscule powers of flameless optimization to get by. Many legends and religions have their basis in embellished stories from this period, the true nature of the deified’s abilities slipping through the fingers of oral tradition.

### The Dwindling (395 \- 431 AL)

Without any kindlegems or flamescribes, the practice of firekeeping was extremely limited, and the decentralized nature of society made documentation difficult. As such, the age of the wanderflames was gradually overshadowed by physical development. In addition, with the wanderflames beginning to sink into legend, religions began to form around the tales of their deeds. Notable examples include the Brytho's Disciples: later evolving into Emrallism, the Roseine Squires: later Rusacavanism, and Those of the Trifold Thunder: later Guravyanism.

## Age of Second Light (432 \- Present)

### Founding Period (432 \- 467 AL)

Gimyndine and its resonating properties were rediscovered, and the results were controversial. Some saw the power of legends descended to do good, while others saw evil's temptation to false divinity.   
Sensing a possible loss of control, the former Order of the Roseine Knight–now called the Rusacavan Ascendancy–adopted the Stoneghost Doctrine . The doctrine contained much of the current system of Carvers and Wraithtamers in Monêfor, and denounced gimyndine as "shards of temptation itself" to be handled only by professionals, and only for the purposes of combating "heretical" wanderflame imitators and containing the "great plague" of gimyndine. The program worked well, and to this day only licensed carvers and wraithtamers are allowed to handle gimyndine in the majority of the Monêforan countries, and even some in West Anndalor.  
In addition to a religious upheaval, or perhaps in tandem with it, many noble structures were reformed as gimyndine became the major resource of power. Many old thrones changed hands, and many borders were pushed and pulled to capture crystallized power.

### Age of Conquest (468 \- 829 AL)

As power began to solidify, many nations began to grow larger than ever before, with the skill of great gimynkeepers nurturing nascent empires. In particular many powers pushed outwards from Lake Provenance, such as Ayangatal and Daksinaranya.  
The center parts of the age include the Halanian Gimyn Wars, wherein Monêforan colonies in Halisan sought to conquer the westerly Kuthjïuman tribes using their gimyndine advantage. Beginning in 608 and concluding in 612, Drüten Alwathend Witafjürgen led the combined forces of western Halisan to victory, resulting in the creation of the modern Jïumannian states and the Reijëngäd.

### Kingmaker Period (830 \- 971 AL)

Marked by the discovery of the first kingstone, this period saw firekeeping power, resources, and knowledge become self-congregating, leading many nations to rapidly expand into great empires. Some of the more notable include the Ceauvian Kingdom, the Jinzuhai Empire, and the Ayangatalan Empire.  
The Ceauvian empire was the first to rise, with Queen Senne VIII’s discovery of the first kingstone. During her reign of the next 17 cycles, the Ceauvian Kingdom added numerous colonies and states to their dominion, including much of east and central Halisan, southern Tohnipras, and the entirety of the Monêforan continent. Their economy was largely based on their dominion of trade in the entire western hemisphere, assisted by the harvesting of dreamleaf, gimyndine, and torhith in the colonies.  
The Jinzuhai Empire was the next to form–largely in response to the economic domination of the Roseine–in 472 AL with the uniting of the greatships under Lung Xuan Zhe and the Jinzu trade company. Functioning more like an alliance than an empire, it was nonetheless headed by powerful flamepairs descended from the Zhe family, though officially decided by vote. Through sheer economic power, and a domination of naval affairs, they controlled virtually all trade in the surrounding waters. Due to this, they frequently entered into conflict with the Roseine’s colonization efforts, and funded many of the later independence movements.  
Finally, the Ayangatalans rose in central Anndalor from the Thundering Hills in a union of various nomadic villages, the cultural implications of which are still felt in the high value of independence and travel in many Ayangatalan cultures today. In the ages before, the Thundering Hills were only home to many tribes of scattered nomads, but this changed in around 753 AL with the Grand Conquest. A movement that was started in the center of the plains by the “Sharpened Thunderstroke” Khünudai Ayaskaagan, an unnaturally talented scriptlighter and martial leader, the Grand Conquest was a large-scale unification war which brought all the Thundering Hills under his control.

### Industrial Period (972 \- Present)

The current era of the central calendar, roughly 1008 cycles (7 grandcycles) after the Day of First Light. Tools that can make advanced use of gimyndine are available to those with the ability to use them, but due to the rarity of strong gimyndine and the ability to use it, many get by with gimpowder technology. This makes any sort of scriptlighter, one who can utilize colored gimyndine to light flamescript, a very powerful and valuable person to many towns and even nations. Those that cannot tolerate gimyndine, however, are forced out into the wilderness or the company of the various copperleaf tribes.

### The Day of Gilded Daggers

In 806 AL, Emperor Voyétol III sent an expedition to the Eastern coast of Halisan to investigate the “uncivilized lands” for potential resources. They were greeted with pleasantries by the native Áren, and peaceful relations existed for a long while, until the discovery of the Áren’s rich gimyndine reserves. The mandates of the Stoneghost Doctrine took over, and in 813 AL, a greatship full of carvers and wraithtamers arrived on the coasts of Halisan with empire in mind.

### Jïumannian Wars of Expression (832 AL)

The Jïumannian Wars of Expression, otherwise called the Jïumannian Revolutionary War, was a war fought between the then-Colonies of Casulon and the Gran Monarché du Roseine. The war was instigated by rising tensions in the firekeeping colonies from the repressive Stoneghost Doctrine, and was one of the events accredited with the beginning of the Resurgence.  
It originally began with the native colonies fighting the royal colonies, sparked emotionally by the Roseine’s severe regulation of firekeeping, and kept practically-minded by a desire to protect their own land. The royal colonies were reluctant to allow the natives to escape colonialism, as it would mean their lucrative trade relationship with the Roseine mainland would cease.  
A key turning point in the war was the Jinzuhai Empire agreeing to assist the native colonies. If Casulon were to turn independent, the royal colonies would be forced to give their trade to Jinzuhai instead, and it would give casus belli for an alliance with the Ayangatalan against the Roseine’s colonies and general over-expansion.  
A special Jinzuhai interest was the Roseine colonies in southern Tohnipras, which is one of the few locations capable of growing soulspice, a powerful psychedelic that boosts the gimynfire which one could draw from a gimyn. The Knights made use of this drug to maintain their grip on the populace, but it would turn a profit on the open market, or even be useful in the fight against the Roseine.




What follows is the last-known theories of the [[The Hythean Empire|Hythean]] scientific diaspora at large, and is largely unsubstantiated, but simultaneously not disproven. The nature of the theory leaves it somewhat unprovable with current technology, and more akin to theology.

## Küranna's Theory of Data

An antiquated combined theory of physics and [[The Phlogistic Model|intuitive phenomena]] developed by [[Küranna of Palkûaka|Hythean Truthseeker Küranna]] regarding the underlying nature of intuitive phenomena, describing the universe as being composed of three fundamental data: Qualia, Axiom, and Substance. Reality is described and processed through Axioms, granted form and motion through Substance, and finally perceived through Qualia.  

The three elementary aspects of firekeeping–scriptlighting, flowfiring, and coupling–each are manipulations of these three fundamental data for paracausal purposes. Each uses a unique energy drawn from a unique layer of existence, and each can more easily achieve certain effects than the others.  

In modern times, this theory has been disproven by the existence and structure of the Conscious Plane, though parts of it remain helpful in the conceptualization of engrams. It is also hypothesized that rather than being inaccurate, the theory more accurately described the universe’s structure *before* the Folly of Küranna, given that the Hytheans produced highly advanced technology based on the theory. Thus some believe cosmology somehow collapsed into its modern presentation as a result of this event. The idea that foundational cosmology could shift without something deeper remaining constant is naturally unpopular, and so the current goal of proponents of this theory is to discover that underlying system, rather than accepting the Conscious Plane model as the most accurate to date.

### Qualia

The energy of sensation, imagination, and creative mental processes, contained within the Conscious Field. Beings composed of pure qualia are called Souls; their duty being to tend to the Fields of the Oversoul until they are incarnated. Qualia is further split into 4 categories:

* **Self** \- Qualia of self-reflectance, paired with Ecstacy and Grief.  
  * **Other** \- Qualia of an outside individual, paired with Admiration and Loathing.  
  * **Group** \- Qualia of a community, paired with Anticipation and Anger.  
  * **Condition** \- Qualia of a concept, paired with Fear and Surprise.

### Axioms

Referred to as abyssine, it is the structure of knowledge, calculation, and logic, drawn from the Ocean of Nous. Beings made of axioms are called Ideals, who swim and compete in the Seas of Reason. Axioms can be further divided into:  
  * **True** \- A true statement  
  * **False** \- A false statement  
  * **Unknowable** \- A statement which can’t be proven  
  * **Paradox** \- A statement which contradicts itself  
Those who are skilled in the generation and utilization of axioms are called Truthseekers, and they are renowned for the abilities of foresight, deduction, and information processing.

### Substance

The energy of existence, form, and history, siphoned from the World Pillars. Beings of vistone are called Elementals, who mine the Pillars for Vistone and build new constructs to the specifications of Axioms. All forms of vistone can be categorized into:   
  * **Crystal** \- An orderly structure, bound in a rigid and repeating pattern.  
  * **Fluid** \- A connected structure, bound with elastic links capable of breaking to change shape.  
  * **Ion** \- An isolated structure unable to form physical bonds, typically of a high energy.  
  * **Radiation** \- An ephemeral structure, unable to form bonds of any kind and easily absorbed by other structures.  
Those who are skilled in the manipulation of vistone are referred to as Architects, known for their ability to create and destroy matter nearly effortlessly. Vistone itself resembles a sort of iridescent mica, constantly shifting in pattern as if it is physically incapable of remaining still. An ironic property, considering its ties to history.
## The Self
### Soulfire Core
### Abyssine Mind
### Vistone Body
    
## World Pillars
### Grand Pillars
The supporting pillars of all the sections of the quilted universe, seeming to resemble pyramids that continually get smaller as the origin is approached, yet never seem to get any less infinite. They are in the same pit as the archives temporal, but are distinguished by their noticeably grander size. Much like the archives temporal, they *can* be entered, although doing so is generally ill-advised. Given that the singular archives can cause stress even for natural-born elementals, the archives of whole universes induce a total lysis of the vistone body, resulting in effective banishment from the world pillars or even death, if the body is all there is.
### Archives Temporal

A large area resembling a bottomless cavern filled with massive pillars of constantly shifting, ringed sedimentary vistone. Each pillar chronicles the history of everything from objects to concepts and ideas. In their base form, each pillar is responsible for the history of a singular particle, which needless to say is quite inconvenient. Thankfully, the pillars are capable of merging and connecting as if they were being melded, forming into the histories of larger conglomerate objects. The method for doing this is something known only to the Archivists, a title used to refer to both Elementals–who know it by instinct–and certain groups of sapients–who learn it through practice.  

The structure of each pillar is similar to a tower library, and is entered by walking directly through the vistone. Upon entering the vistone, the archivist is flooded with information in raw form gathered since the beginning of time. This can stun those off their guard, or even drive the unprepared mad. A skilled archivist will bend the stone around them, navigating through the record like scrolling through a vinyl. The experience is said to be quite surreal and oddly calming, as if one is being comforted by knowledge.
### Entropic Mines

An area of the world pillars where new vistone is mined and exported to the various archives and worlds. Unlike the archives, the mines resemble a system of caverns filled with the rhythmic pounding of vistone being wrenched from the walls by elementals. The network is constantly shifting as the various tunnels are shortened and reconnected periodically to keep transportation simple. The vistone is carried through the tunnels by train-like elementals that seem to skim and slide along the ceiling, eventually digging through at some predetermined point to their destination.
## Ocean of Nous
### Engram of Engrams
### Forest of Unending Minds
### Sea of Sparks
### Memetic Reef
## Fields of the Oversoul
### Greater Conscious Field

The hypothesized final destination of drifting souls, and the logical conclusion of an observed paradox. Though with death, souls lose their conscious skin and begin drifting at the whim of the currents, they remain impervious to damage and tend to stay bound to the planet. However, there is not an ocean of every soul from all history covering the surface. Thus, the souls must be going somewhere.



## Arenfürich

One of the native states of Jïumannes, it contains the entirety of the Arenfürich rainforest and the majority of the Áren people. It borders Tereghda, Tuihorm, and Hynawyll, and has a majority coastline of both the Dreiamis Gulf and the Gedwolmis Gulf. Its capital is Raulhejärga, where the representatives of major city-states meet to discuss national policy and developments.

### Gilded Heirs (Highwalkers)

There exists a major distinction in the hierarchy of Arenfürich, dubbed by the general populace as the “Gilded Heirs.” The name describes the heirs of the 3 major families which control Arenfürich’s major statewide industries, and the most powerful seats on the council. The heirs are often very close to each other, as to encourage political unity they are raised like siblings, though this has been known to produce undesirable rivalries as well.  

In terms of a political structure, the role of council overseer takes the form of a triumvirate between the three heirs, each having their own authoritative lineage and seat to pass down. The constitutional power of the overseer is locked behind a total agreement of the three powers, a restriction thought to guarantee rational compromises and justice by the Áren people. For this reason, many Áren consider their government to be somewhat more advanced than other forms of central authority.  

Widely considered the “head” of the gilded heirs and the closest thing Arenfürich has to a ruling family, the Treöheira are the most powerful of the three lineages and control the highly lucrative rainwax industry. Especially dominant in the northwestern valleys, they also hold stakes in associated business like casul manufacturing and construction. Their most important alliance is with the Nakawürtas, who assist in shipping their products to eastern Halisan.  

Perhaps the 2nd most powerful of the Golden Heirs are the Toracrufs, who maintain exclusive mining rights to the massive torhith deposits of the steamrise caves, highly valued by nobility almost globally for its unparalleled display of colors and brilliance. They maintain a similar deal with the Treöheiras and Nakawürtas, where the Toracrufs’ claim is protected by the Treöheira’s forces in exchange for offering them first pick and a significant discount.  

The Nakawürtas are the last of the Gilded Heirs, and make their business in creating specialized boats capable of navigating the Réokea river, as well as in trading upon the river itself and within greater Jïumannes. This is somewhat helped by their agreement with the Treöheira, granting them monopolistic control over the river–enforced by the Treöheira’s armed forces–in exchange for buying slickwax exclusively from the Treöheira and supporting them in government.

### Argent Heirs (Raincatchers)

Besides the upper 3 gilded heirs, there are also the lower 9 argent heirs, branch families of the gilded heirs which serve the triumvirate in positions including border control, peacekeeping, and naval operations.  
The Huthleod are a prominent family of the argent heirs, a branch of the Nakawürta family that primarily maintains the navy, but also owns a large amount of seafaring businesses, and is the chief regulator of their affairs. They largely operate out of the Gedwolmis gulf, and though not as wealthy as the other families, still possess a treasury on scale with them.  
Jëthwera is another name belonging to the argent heirs, yet is also known across Halisan for the quality of their tools, innovations, and most importantly, powderstaffs. If a powderstaff or set of shimmerplate doesn’t bear the Jëthwera brand, few Áren warriors will trust its quality. They supply mainly to the Huthleod and Aeldorfästen, but also to the larger armies of each heir and even the heirs themselves.  
The Aeldorfästen are the lowest of the argent heirs, due to their position as operators of the various Arenfürich state fortresses and border guard. Their funds, however, are gained through foreign mercenary contracts and even a number of contracted soulforging monasteries. This vertical integration is a large part of their success, but has also put them on the radar of the more cautious families.


## Arwyn Tribes

A gathering of similar native tribes confined to Hynawyll Valley and its copperleaf forest. Almost homogeneously populated with the Kaithurhi and their subspecies of the Muintaferan, with an extraordinarily small minority of by-chance-luciant miscellaneous species like Áren.

### Eldwyth

The coastal ones. Rivers wine, orange, and blue. Part of the river rose. Their culture is heavily based on fishing, community, and self-sufficiency.

### Trowyth

The middle northeast ones. Rivers red and yellow. The remainder of the river rose. Their culture is based on hunting, curiosity and spirituality.

### Feynwyth

The middle-south ones. Only the river white.

### Durwyth

The middle-north ones. The rivers cyan, lime, and violet. The second, sub-branch of the river red.

### Alþwyth


## Bergheim

A landlocked nation small in scale but noticeable in population, situated among almost the entirety of the Strahlerz mountain range. It has 2 super-large cities, the larger and capital city of Drestog, and the smaller but still large Klifval. Contains almost entirely Schausen, but the majority of the upper class is Marmeial.

### Drestog

The gargantuan capital city of Bergheim, which is built into a massive pre-existing cavern supported by numerous ancient pillars. These ancient pillars are, in reality, the remains of a hythean-era facility shielded from the physical effects of Küranna’s Folly by the surrounding mountain rock. It did, however, deposit a great deal of gimyndine in the mountain, in addition to the high density of gimyndized luciants given the nature of the facility.  
The actual nature of the facility was three parts: a long-term storage warehouse for delicate technologies, nuclear waste, and the like, a self-operating hybrid geothermal and nuclear power plant to ensure longevity of operation, and an underground city that arose just outside it as a natural consequence of the two.  
The majority of the actual city of Drestog is located on the ruins of the hythean city proper, in the upper levels of the caverns. The nobility and guild-workers live and operate in the cooler, upper sections, whereas the lower classes find themselves bunching up against the freezing warehouses and sweltering reactors. Some of the more desperate even plunder the warehouses like game dungeons, fighting security droids to bring back marvelous trinkets for sale at the markets.


## Duichkor

A native state of Jïumannes inhabiting the south-eastern mountainous peninsula. Their governmental structure is notable for being rather technocratic, as the political leaders are also headmasters of various Stellar Monasteries, which in practice function much more like universities.



## Gytrima






## Scarlet Wreath

An insurgent, fascist organization within Arenfürich which utilizes a warped vision of the Stormrider period to advocate for a “genetically pure” Arenfürich by expelling luciants and low-resonators, and encouraging the empowerment of strong resonators by careful regulation of the gimyndine supply–portrayed in a non-freedom-limiting way as “giving power to only those worthy of using it, and out of the hands of the Flameless.”

### Platform

The Scarlet Wreath’s main appeal and platform is centered around traditional fascist themes such as old glory (the Stormrider Period: less industrialization \[read: classist against the advancing raincatchers\] and widespread gimyndine use and regulation, with little gimpowder) eugenics for a “pure” nation (eradicating the “Flameless” \[a slur for luciants and low-resonators\]) and old mythos (a heavy focus on myths surrounding the Stormriders and their valor.)  
The traditional values of Áren society place a high degree of importance on homogeny, a holdover from the revolutionary days when a push to the last few men necessitated strict unification. This led to a general valuing of communalism, and the view of those unable to fill their role in the expected way as outcasts.

## Guild of the Twelve

Commonly referred to as the Twelves, it is the biggest “union” or “guild” of practicing [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] in the world. Based on an artificial island in the center of Lake Provenance, they oversee the development of firekeeping technologies and treatment of [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] for the majority of the western continents. They were first established shortly after the Gimyndine Revolution, as the people began to suspect the [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] of abusing their power and hunted them. The guild was thus formed by 12 original [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]], six flamescribes and six scriptlighters as a protection pact, though the group quickly expanded until it more resembled the organization present today.

### Fire Names

Members of the Twelves have an official “fire name” to identify their rank and person, consisting of two parts. The first, their rank; the second, a personally chosen word. This system was originally to protect the identities of [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] during the last embers of the gimynhunt era, and largely remains out of tradition.

### Scriptlighter Ranks

Scriptlighter ranks are gained when one is able to best a member of their own rank in an official lighter’s duel, granting them ascension to the next. If they beat a member of a higher rank, they ascend to the rank above that. Losing a rank only occurs when losing to a lower rank, not to a same-rank. A list of ranks is as follows:

1. **Disciple** \- The highest rank, only attainable by besting a current Disciple. Due to the original rank belonging to the personally chosen successor of each founding member, there are always exactly 12 disciples in the organization. Notably, the disciple's titles follow the unique pattern of Disciple \[NAME\] of \[FOUNDER\] 

2. **Professor** \- The second highest rank, there are 49 in the world. Typically directly apprenticed to the Disciple of their chosen field.

3. **Mentor** \- The third highest rank, there are 343 in the world.

4. **Highkeeper** \- The fourth highest rank, there are around 2,500 in the world. This marks the beginning of the “elite.”

5. **Lowkeeper** \- The 3rd lowest rank, there are around 17,000 in the world.

6. **Student** \- The 2nd to lowest rank, there are over 100,000 in the world.

7. **Initiate** \- The lowest rank, there are around a million in the world.
### Known Disciples and Archmentors

* **Deus Magicus Asclepia** \- Real name Küranna, an ancient nebvoltsi who is only referred to in guild canon. Many believe them to be a symbolic figure, emblematic of what the Twelves hope to become.

* **Disciple Bismithius of Alakon** \- Real name King Alexander V of Ceauvia, a Leaudoré male.
## The Nine Disciplines

  Meritocracy in Bergheim is largely represented by the Nine Disciplines, the largest guilds of the most respected professions. These professions each elect their leaders by annual relevant tournaments, and the leader is responsible for governing their respective sector under the supervision of the king.

  Most well-known among the Nine Disciplines is the craft of kindlegems. In addition there is gimyndine engineering, artifice, gimyndine mining, and scriptcraft. The remaining mundane four are agriculture, military, artistry, and study.
### The Royal Seat

  Most notably, the monarch and rulership are treated as the 0th discipline, and in addition to primogeniture a prospective monarch must pass the King’s Gauntlet. Technically, any citizen of Bergheim can challenge the current monarch and seize the throne by claiming victory. The royal succession then uses them as a zero point and continues until the next disruption. However, the consequences of failing are complete banishment, and so no family in recent history has challenged house saun Weilz.

### The Sons of Gondoe

  The 1st seat of the nine disciplines, and the largest guild of artificers in Bergheim. Currently headed by the Weilshauz family, a close one to the royal family.

### Hrunda’s Union

  The 2nd seat of the nine disciplines, most prominent among the guilds of Bergeim flamescribes. Led by the Bersedt clan, with clan matriarch Erstin Bersedt. Specializes in scriptcraft, and as such is a majority female guild.
  ## Academia

### Witafjürgen University

An institution nearly as old as Jïumannes itself, Witafjürgen University is an institution of higher learning and professional association located within the holy mountains of Tuihorm, and established by Fyrehter Witacruf with a number of academic and firekeeping professionals. In keeping with the meaning of its name, a “Forest of the Wise,” Witafjürgen’s principal purpose is as a professional group of [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] and academics, which has a secondary purpose of teaching and screening potential new members of the group.

Witafjürgen is composed of six individual colleges, each dedicated to one area of research, and founded by one of Witacruf’s associates. Each college includes and manages their own undergraduate and graduate education, research, and professional unions. The main connecting line is their organizational structure, with each college being led by a master and their head professors (“tenures” in the vernacular), further subordinated by regular professors. The master of each college then serves on a board, which meets with the Grandmaster to decide on matters relating to the whole university.

In no particular order, the colleges are the: 

* Leombjürna College of Hagnomists  
* Nichtfryth College of Soulsmiths  
* Tdahiya College of Scribes  
* Skógrekin College of Flamebearers  
* Krifcalon College of Lapidaries  
* Eglavoé College of Artificers

## Cavern Gangs

### General Summary

  Throughout the city of Drestog are groups of people called “caverunners,” criminals that perform everything from petty theft to grand larceny and escape by the labyrinthian network of old caves and ancient facilities beneath the city, which contain strange technology that operates like artifice firekeeping without the use of gimyndine. Some groups are even known to specialize in collecting ancient trinkets or weapons.

### Nachstein

  A large gang centered around the retrieval and sale of intact ancient artifacts from the Warehouse section of the ruins.



### Artifice

The study of combining [[flamescript]] with machinery, giving rise to contraptions capable of [[firekeeping]]. The field is further broken down into fields normally associated with purely physical engineering: Aerial artifice, mechanical artifice, etc. The distinction is practical as not all environments are as conducive to [[gimyndine]] as others, and some applications simply don’t merit the complexity of phlogistic techniques.


# Firekeeping

Applied [[phlogistics]] for various purposes, including engineering, medicine, and many other fields.

---
## Usage

All firekeeping begins with the generation of [[Soulfire]], which is then manipulated in some manner to achieve some effect. It can be suddenly compressed to exert an explosive pressure, run over [[flamescript]] to affect [[Engram|engrams]], or used for its [[The Phlogistic Model#Fluidic Pressure|fluid mechanics]], in increasing order of complexity.

All life can control ambient [[soulfire]] and even produce its own, but sourcing it from [[gimyndine]] is much more potent and allows easier use when integrated with [[Kindlegem]]. This led to [[gimyndine]] technology and its derivatives becoming the forefront of development for centuries, and many self-sourced firekeeping techniques became relegated to folk contexts or small communities, where the usage of [[gimyndine]] was either impractical from extenuating circumstance, or rejected on principle.
## Fields of Firekeeping



### Ghostbreathing

The process of ghostbreathing, referred to in euphemism as "playing the keeper's gambit," is a process by which a [[firekeeper]] takes gimynfire directly into their own flesh and bone, infusing it into their very bodies. To them is granted a nigh-transcendent, even surrealist familiarity with the power that now engorges their veins, allowing for sublime masterworks of what seems divinely-imagined scriptcraft and elegant movements of tremendous force and velocity. 

The cost, however, is titanic to match. The longer a keeper sustains the gambit, the further their body hardens and turns to lifeless gimyndine, crystallizing into a stone which will hold the very power they are devouring so greedily in the moment. Not only that, but each moment the state is held is accompanied by a flash of foreign memory; a sensation not of one's own mind, but of the fire they siphoned. With repeated uses of the technique–if one is lucky enough to survive the first usage–one may even slowly lose the ability to distinguish between the whispers of the stone and the memories of the real. Slowly–imperceptibly, but inevitably–one becomes another. The stone lives in torment. This is how one joins them.


### Hagnomy

The study of [[Soulfire]] and [[Conscious Plane]], and how soulfire interacts with itself. It involves the study of [[Engram#Abstraction Drag|abstraction drag]], [[infusion]] techniques, [[Phlogistic Computing]], resonance, [[Soulfire#gimynfire|gimynfire]] control, and other fields. Essentially, hagnomy is to firekeeping like physics is to engineering. 

Hagnomists are often looked down on as people who can’t focus on reality, but other [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] appreciate their curiosity for the abstract.


### Immersionists

A tradition that draws chiefly from flamescribing, and is focused entirely on firekeeping’s potential to “tell a story.” Immersionists make use of [[flamescript]] and [[Engram|engrams]] manipulating [[Soulfire]] in the emotional axes, bypassing sensory organs and presenting what amounts to an artificial experience or memory directly to the target. Practitioners range from travelling storytellers to masters of spycraft, as the same tools which paint a new reality naturally paint over the existing one, allowing for presence and image modification, while masters may even *immerse* targets in entirely false realities.


### Lightburning

An ancient technique lost in the Hythean Era, which greatly strengthens soulfire’s material presence and energy content. To lightburn, the most important trait is an intensely focused desire grounded in the world; e.g. to save a loved one, defeat an enemy, etc. When a user recognizes and embraces this desire, resolving to hunt it no matter the obstacles, their soulfire becomes singularly aligned and laser focused, moving in perfect accordance and notable density. Additionally, the user becomes able to exert a greater conscious force at further distance, effectively gaining range.

While lightburning, a user will be granted an incredibly enhanced physical fortitude and capacity for strength, heightened physical senses and intuition, and even the ability to harden soulfire into physical constructs while in contact with the body. Reports of the process by wielders also note a peculiar mindset consuming them while fully embracing the technique, not unlike a single-minded focus or “flow state.”


### Meldcraft

A discipline which takes advantage of coupling’s ability to mix and shuffle molecular bonds for alloying, engineering, and artistic purposes. It is especially common in cultures where scriptlighters are viewed less as tools of war and more tools of convenience, mostly focused in Tohnipras and Riihya.

More than any other school of firekeeping, meldcraft relies heavily on [[Kindlegem]] improved over many generations and kept as close family secrets, due to the incredibly precise nature of molecular structure. A common way the problem is simplified is with the granular model, which simplifies materials into discrete granules to be managed. With this method, the mark of skill is the “resolution” of a work, or how small the granules can be made.

In engineering, meldcraft is often used to make extremely strong bonds and materials not normally possible. One material commonly used in place of steel for high-demand applications is silver-steel, a melded alloy which combines extreme-hardness linear-grain tungsten with a backplate of pliable blacksteel.


Phlogistic computing is the practice of careful, deliberate control over the motions of soulfire for the purposes of computation. The structured engram responsible for abstracting such computation is referred to as a thought engine. It is sometimes thought that the human brain encodes a thought engine of some kind.
%%
Analog computer: turns continuous input signals into continuous output signals.
Digital computer: turns discrete input into discrete output

TO-DO:
- Processor (encoding logic)
- Data Transfer
- Data Storage
%%
## Architecture
Thought engines have two key advantages over mechanical computers: a lack of physical limitations like heat dissipation and signal noise, and a protean structure. This leads to many unique features, including volumetric circuitry, multiphasic memory, and true abstract simulation.

Given that all phlogistic computers operate based on unrestricted logic, they are capable of perfectly emulating any physical method of computing, except for true error. For example, a phlogistic computer is perfectly capable of running probabilistic algorithms that depend upon physical phenomenon, such as a common method of prime factorization.

aliases:
  - Psychomorphic
---
## Psychomorphism
A skill possessed by all [[Soulkeeping|soulkeepers]] to some degree, psychomorphism is the ability to reshape one's body according to a mental self-image, and is the most fundamental skill to medicinal [[firekeeping]].

Notably, though many [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] possess some degree of psychomorphism, few have total control over their presentation, and are often limited strictly to restoration. Those with with further control, being able to modify their sex, appearance, or even bodily structure at will, are referred to as *psychomorphic*.


### Soulforging

The lesser-known assistant to many flamepairs, soulsmiths are those who make use of infusion and its techniques to craft tools and weapons with their bare hands. In addition to convenience–especially in environments disagreeable to fire, like Arenfürich or the Tohneasian Mist-forests–the process of using gimynfire during the forging process gives the product a higher tolerance for [[infusion]] and a smoother response to manipulation. The process also allows for precise melding and rending, facilitating complex alloys and intricate shapes.


## Soulkeeping

### Synopsis

Also known in stoneghost cultures as “savage flames,” or “devil’s breath,” soulkeeping is the practice of firekeeping while using one’s own soul as a source of intention. The technique is most common in the Kuthjïuman and Llantakúna, especially in farming castes such as the Kuthjïuman arteries or Llantakúna mistwalkers, but has been known to also occur in revolutionary figures in grandiose fashion.

### Divine Arts

Divine Arts are a subset of soulkeeping which utilizes **true engrams**, which are those that become engraved upon the soul’s form over the course of life.

Unlike typical firekeeping, which requires deep concentration to form flamescript often prior to actual use, divine arts are much quicker and easier. The rather apparent downside is the difficulty of acquiring as significant a variety of effects as a compendium of scripted engrams might offer. However, given that true engrams are as familiar to the user as they get, they are thus highly efficient in regards to soulfire consumption.

Users of true engrams are called **divine**, and their arts as such, in large part from their theorized prevalent role in forming many idolic religions. Examination of historical records provides significant evidence that suggests many founding figures obtained their relatively tremendous power through true engrams, which to a script-less people appeared works of divinity.

### Engraving

The process of actually engraving a true engram is entirely subconscious, and highly dependent on deep-set personal interests, beliefs, and other traits. Often rather than choosing an engram, one’s own divine art will gradually develop and shape over time as they become more familiar with soulkeeping. For example, a phlogistician who spent their life studying soulfire’s interactions with spacetime might develop a divine art allowing them to directly manipulate it without forming the intricate flamescript.

In contrast to this gradual process, some arts are “gifted” after particularly memorable experiences, and are typically of some vague relation to the original memory. Note that “memorable” does not imply “traumatic,” as an equal number of arts have been gifted for making a sudden breakthrough in learning as for witnessing a shade’s slaughter. These arts in particular are often unexplainably exotic and anthropocentrically defined for their soulfire consumption, and are a point of frequent study in modern phlogistics.

### Genetic Engrams (Gengrams)

A form of inborn permanent engram inscribed into the soul and brain of a person, often with fantastical effects for their low soulfire cost. A majority of gengrams are inherited, a sort of resonance with the genetic engram of a divine ancestor. Assuming personalities (and subsequently phase sets) are genetic, it can be thought of like a similar composition causing an old pattern to rise to the surface.

### Generation Arts

A consequence of soulfire’s ease of use within the body, a common method of simplistic ranged attack for soulkeepers is the generation and manipulation of blood. Although it is technically possible to use hair or another material, blood is the most versatile while being relatively cheap to regenerate through soul assertion. The arts are limited by the requirement that each stream connect back to the main body at all times, but they are nonetheless deadly in capable hands.

### Blood Infusion

The practice of engulfing objects in a prospective user's blood, granting the tool the ability to interact with soulfire, engrams, and shades. The technique is preferred by many keepers able to utilize soul assertion as a means of combustion delivery compared to direct infusion. Though it requires constant regeneration, many practitioners find the ease of infusing and maneuvering blood preferable to infusing a metallic weapon.

Objects coated with infused blood are also able to hold flamescript for a highly extended, near-indefinite duration. For this reason, individuals with true engrams that function well with weapons have an advantage over those who don't with regards to combat. They are also highly prized as potential scripters for custom weapons, though not many divine soulkeepers will so easily allow their engrams to be used due to their highly personal nature. Furthermore, divine engrams are notoriously difficult to comprehend by anyone other than their originator, with the task often considered sisyphean.


# Telecorporation

The process of using phlogistics to achieve an effect like teleportation, by converting the body into a dense shell of fire around the soul and accelerating it with an Alcubierre-like intention field. This removes the acceleration limit placed by infusion slipping, but requires extreme skill with corporeal/intuitive manipulation and self-determination.

It is also possible to transport non-organic mass this way, but it suffers such a large conversion penalty as to be impractical for anything beyond personal equipment. Similarly, it's even more difficult to transport persons other than oneself in this manner. However, some Hythean-era relics are known to encode highly efficient algorithms that make this feasible, given a designated fixed point.

### Abstraction Drag

On the construction of engrams, the chief element in the required amount of soulfire is how exhaustive the engram's "description" is. If, for example, one engram called simply for "heat" while another called for "the air molecules nearest the user's hand to thermally vibrate," the second would cost much less soulfire, in exchange for being more taxing to execute. Such verbosity is naturally harder to maintain a picture of, and the ability to carefully abstract and delineate engrams is a major component of a flamescribe's skill.  This decrease in efficiency based on logical inconsistencies or blanks is referred to as abstraction drag, and is thought to hint at the nature of soulfire. That is, it serves to bridge the gap between logic and desire: the smaller the gap, the less you need.


### The Conscious Plane

Also known as the collective unconscious, the afterlife, or the Shadowless Dream, the conscious plane is defined as a conjoined space overlapped with material reality, and a central component of [[The Phlogistic Model]] of intuitive phenomena. The conscious plane is so named for its role in housing the soul and its processes, such as thought, choice, and emotion. At the time of writing, competing theories disagree on whether consciousness is a consequence of soulfire or vice versa.

Careful investigation has revealed that the conscious plane is filled with a kind of noise, theorized to be the result of infinitely many unique fluctuation patterns overlapping and destructively interfering. Soulfire is brought into existence along with change in the conscious plane’s structure and unraveled by tidal forces, and thus a small amount of soulfire percolates throughout reality in accordance with the noise.

Additionally, though the conscious plane is named so, current science can only confirm it maps to the 3 spatial and singular temporal dimensions, but not that the plane is constrained to these. In particular, souls are believed to be rather high-dimensional to account for their complexity, perhaps extending into compactified extra dimensions. No known ethical methods of empirically testing this theory have been developed, though many [[fireborn]] and trained practitioners of natural firekeeping report being able to “feel” the shape of their soul, to varying results.
### Fundamental Phases

The fundamental phases are the hypothetical base-level intention fields responsible for determining the curvature of the conscious plane, and the fundamental units of personality. Each phase is thought to hold its own pattern of responding to conscious stimuli, including other phases.

### Impressions

An impression is a region of higher than average curvature in the conscious plane, caused by a congregation of soulfire around an organic object or other construct uniquely adapted to receive certain patterns of soulfire fluctuation. Such regions tend to form around living objects, as the structure of life naturally lends itself to resonating with the phases, with each organism favoring different patterns.

### Field Equivalence

A component of many emerging theories at time of composition is the notion that soulfire and the conscious plane are identical on some deep, fundamental level. That is, soulfire is a compactified form of the conscious plane, and the conscious plane is a vast sea of soulfire. This has many implications on its own, but some unified theories which attempt to marry phlogistics to physical science even go so far as to say physical matter and energy have a similar relation with some as yet undetected field.

### Curvature

According to the [[The Phlogistic Model|current phlogistic model]] of [[Conscious Plane|the conscious plane]] as a four dimensional manifold, [[Soulfire|soulfire]] interacts with the plane in such a manner as to be compelled to follow geodesics in the plane rather than reality. In simple terms, the structure of the plane generates gravitational forces which are exerted on soulfire, allowing for its movement. Additionally, soulfire is observed not to follow null geodesics, meaning it has a sense of “mass” that inhibits it. This imaginary mass can be similarly measured in soul planes, and seems to be dependent on their “density” as mentioned in refinement.

### Engram

An engram is any fully self-contained program for [[Soulfire]] manipulation, typically encoded within [[Flamescript]] to produce a complex effect like state manipulation, chemical processing, or algorithmic computation. Each is further classified according to their modus operandi: 

Alteration engrams manipulate soulfire distribution within a localized section to increase their [[Soul|soul’s]] influence, in order to influence the local rules of state evolution. When applied to the wider [[Conscious Plane|plane]], they cause local distortions in the laws of physics, and are called tuner engrams. These typically present in the form of modifying the relative strength of phenomena, such as weakening gravity or changing the relation between energy and momentum. However, alterations have no theoretical limit, and could completely replace local physics with enough effort.

There is a special classification for alteration engrams performed within a soul plane: epistemic engrams. These bend the conscious plane within for the purpose of altering cognitive processes, and primarily deal with the processing of mental information, including sensory reprocessing, data formatting, algorithmic manipulation, and further computational processes. Such engrams form the foundation for modern analytical procedures, and as such are commonly used by scribes, but can also find use in sensory enhancers for warriors or artists, or improved everyday memory.

Infusion engrams, in contrast, infuse soulfire to become manipulable, pluripotent energy. Within a soul plane, driver engrams provide strength, speed, and regeneration. Without the soul plane, striker engrams induce motion in objects, particles, and fields in contact with the user’s halo.


# Intention Field

Occasionally shortened to simply “**intention**”  

A metric tensor on the conscious plane, often taken in sum by a superposition principle with others. Though not truly a “field,” the name is retained by tradition from older theory.


# Paradigms
As it happens, every conscious plane has its own set of rules on top of the engrammatic laws, referred to as a paradigm. This paradigm is dictated by the fundamental phases constituting the plane, and essentially allows for the programming of the plane, defining additional logic for the movement and behavior of soulfire.


### Phlogistician 
Generally, any practitioner or researcher of intuitive phenomena.

Specifically, a researcher of pure intuitive phenomena and their causes, interactions, and structure. An interrogator of the arcane.


### Phlogistics
The study of intuitive phenomena and their effects on material reality


### The Soul

Under the Phlogistic Model, the soul is a separate region of the conscious plane roughly overlapping the body. When standing curvature passes a certain limit, noise effects become negligible and the constituent phases begin self-stimulating and entering feedback loops with each other. This runaway process results in a curvature singularity, which promptly rebounds into a new, separate conscious plane composed of the phase set, generally reaching hydrostatic equilibrium with the wider plane’s phlogistic pressure in the shape of the body.

The soul is further situated within a region of conscious space called the ***halo***, which has its boundary where foreign soulfire holds the soul’s own in equilibrium with external phlogistic pressure. The movements and vibrations of the soul result in halo soulfire being squashed and stretched, and correspond to the notion of thought and emotion. From this, the model thus posits the conscious soul to be the ultimate center of consciousness, and the seat of the common idea of “the self.”

Given the theory that the soul and conscious plane are the source of cognition and choice, it is prudent to clarify the role of the brain in such a model. While the soul hosts what may well be called the psyche and will, the brain acts like an interface and microcontroller for the body. Under this model, the brain can be treated like a sensory organ for the soul, something which presents information about the material plane to the soul, then interprets and enacts the soul’s whims within it.

But how does the soul communicate with the material plane? It is currently believed that thought necessitates movement in the soul, necessarily causing internal soulfire collisions. This in turn shunts small amounts of soulfire down to communicate the soul’s intentions to the brain, which processes this information into movement and other voluntary functions, while automatically handling involuntary functions.

However, the brain must also communicate with the soul, in order to relay sensory information and recollections. It’s believed that the soul is able to obtain this information from miniature combustions of infused soulfire in the brain. The specific theory is that if conscious wave sources generate soulfire, annihilating soulfire should generate conscious waves as well. This is based on the observation that combustion can be “heard” through pyrrhoreception.

Many scholars debate which exact pieces of the conscious experience the soul and brain are each responsible for. The brain is believed to be the host of short-term memory, while the soul engraves certain long term memories and experiences. The soul handles decision making after gathering processed sensory information from the brain.

The soul is also capable of affecting change within the exterior conscious plane according to a propagation limit. Within the noise, any phase is mostly unable to distinguish itself from the others and thus acts normally, randomly, resulting in close to net zero curvature. A soul creates a region of self-determination, from which information and force can propagate out at light speed, with force losing intensity by an inverse square law.

### Refinement

Despite the generally positive connotation of the term “refinement,” in phlogistics it serves as a catch-all term for reformations of the soul. This includes the original process named as such, the reforging of postnatal fireborn, and the corruption of shades.

The original process, which gave the category its name, involves maintaining a sufficiently high soulfire production state with significant alignment for some length of time. If successful, and often accidental, the spinning soulfire will reach a critical point before collapsing down onto the soul, perfectly merging with it and granting the soul a higher “density.” This results in future movements of the soul inducing more curvature, thus allowing for stronger generation and manipulation. However, it also allows for the same production to be achieved with less movement, thus making previous tasks more efficient.

Refinement also occurs during the process of postnatal firebirth, where an individual undergoes an extreme realization or pattern of thought, resulting in a tremendous volume of soulfire crashing down into their soul plane at once, often initiating a second soul genesis. This reconstructs the soul plane from the ground up, and often the body along with it given the intensity of the phlogistic forces involved. What results in a body and soul more closely aligned with the thoughts that caused the rebirth, often accompanied by a denser and stronger soul plane.

Though decidedly negative, refinement is also the process responsible for the formation and appearance of shades. The chief difference, and a recent discovery with the use of improved pyrrhosensory engrams, is the direction of the soulfire. Rather than in alignment with the soul’s inertia, the soulfire spins with such intensity in an opposing direction, that the soul is bent into conformity until it aligns with the rotation and *then* combines, often trapping the victim in the monstrous form they imagined.

### Souls and Death

A soul, herein defined as a spatially distinct embedded 3-manifold within the conscious plane, permanently encodes what can be defined as a consciousness. The creation of a soul occurs when an impression in the conscious plane undergoes harmonization to the point where a conscious skin forms, eliminating outside noise and allowing the remaining harmonic to self-interfere and recognize itself, driving an exponential process that culminates in its severing from the conscious plane, creating its own embedded region.  

The mechanics of death depend upon the refinement of the dying.  If there remains a naked soul, its power draws it towards the Greater Conscious Field. If the soul retains too much attachment to its world, it will instead remain drifting in the conscious plane as a wandersoul.  

If a being who did not come into possession of a soul dies, the process goes as follows: Once “brain death” takes place, the impression slowly returns to being indistinguishable from the conscious noise.

### Space Density

Uniformity of space density is not a given when transitioning between conscious planes. In fact, most souls, in comparison to the greater conscious plane, are much denser due to their high engrammatic mass. Necessarily, crossing this boundary appropriately stretches or squishes whatever does so. It

### Wandersouls

Wandersouls are created by the mass recognition of some personification, tiny amounts of soulfire unconsciously donated to form an engrammatic mass in imitation of a soul. They can be benevolent, a notable example being the Lord of the Everstorm, the guardian spirit of Arenfürich. However, wandersouls can also be created from rumors or monster tales, and they will act accordingly.  

Wandersouls vary wildly in power, size, and visibility, according to the number and nature of their believers. Often “imaginary friends” are very real, but since only one being believes in their existence, they are nearly invisible and are limited only to spectating or perhaps speaking through conscious vibrations.  

A list of known wandersouls and their locations, descriptions, powerbase, abilities, and behavior is as follows:  
* “Lord of the Everstorm, Raul”  
  * Location: Raulhejëarga Basin, Arenfürich  
  * Description: A country-scale wandersoul responsible for Arenfürich’s highly increased frequency of rain, and its strange mineral content.  
  * Powers: The manipulation of water and especially rain  
  * Behavior: Non-sentient, ambivalent. Very machine-like, it merely seeks to maintain the patterns of rain.

### Worldbound Soul

A curious subset of wandersouls formed when a transcendent soul is rejected, binding them to the place of their transcendence as a wandersoul unreliant on extraneous soulfire to persist. Given that they used to be transcendent, they remain able to generate and control a massive amount of soulfire. However, since they no longer possess a corporeal form, they are unable to use coupling.


### Soulfire

Also called alferhþ (lit. “Fire of the Ferhþ,” where “ferhþ” is a Küthjïuman-Halanian word meaning something between life, heart, and mind, commonly translated as “soul”), soulfire is an energy contained within the [[Conscious Plane]] to host the soul, passively loosed through thought. Thought causes changes in the soul plane, which in turn produces soulfire in reality. Born from consciousness, soulfire is an energy shaped by consciousness, and as such can be controlled after manifestation through intention fields to power actions in reality. It can only be summoned in large quantities by sapient creatures, but all life generates soulfire to some degree.

Soulfire production can also be an intentional process with the right training, but can just as easily run afoul of uncontrollable emotions. Any kind of cyclic, focused thought causes continuous, constant change in the plane’s curvature, generating much more curvature than quick thoughts or intentions. Additionally, the more the recurrent thought pertains to an accurate understanding of the self, the more the motion acts in harmony with the soul’s natural “angular momentum” or “shape” to produce stronger curvature, and thus more soulfire.

However, it’s also possible for spiraling, intensely emotional thoughts to generate power by this same principle. If, for example, an individual undergoes a traumatic experience and incessantly reprimands themself, this constitutes focused, cyclic thought. Furthermore, if the situation is dire enough, they may even begin to truly believe themselves, bending their own soul to fit the spin they generate, and subsequently lose themselves to becoming a Shade, the image of what they believe themselves to be.

Soulfire decay is also an observed phenomenon, and is responsible for the distinct lack of runaway generation that would occur without it. Because soulfire induces some standing curvature, and moving it necessarily involves changing curvature, any soulfire motion technically creates more soulfire. However, motion also generates conscious waves, which are observed to “unravel” soulfire back into the plain. In most combinations of speed and path, the decay wins out and soulfire loses strength the further it travels.

### Soulfire Field

A soulfire field is any conglomeration of uninfused soulfire, which floats around and through matter like a ghostly cloud, not interacting with any of the standard four fundamental forces. This follows naturally from the assumption that uninfused soulfire inhabits the conscious plane. These fields are also generated passively by all living things as a consequence (or prerequisite) of cognition, dubbed a “halo,” and can cause harm if too intensive. Some non-sapient species are capable of harnessing their halo with special chemicals to produce metabolic energy.

### Sparks

Sparks are the result of soulfire's loss of arbitrary precision when brought into quantized reality. It behaves similarly to electromagnetic radiation, and has the unique property of causing sentient beings to experience [[pixies]] when absorbed by their soul. Being able to interact with both soulfire and matter, it allows for both soulfire and soulfire constructs to be seen without intuitive senses, such as by machines and artifacts. It is also highly ionizing, and follows different rules for reflection than standard light.

### Gimynfire
Soulfire produced by gimyndine; often “sharp,” discomforting, and somewhat repulsive.


Given the technical complexity of this file, it’s recommended that first-time readers familiarize themselves with some of the terms used before proceeding.
# The Phlogistic Model   

The predominant theory of [[intuition]] which models such phenomena as being caused by the generation, movement, and decay of [[Soulfire]], itself caused by the curvature of the [[Conscious Plane]], ultimately due to the patterns of the fundamental phases and [[Soulfire]]. In this way, the model situates the phases as the ultimate source of intuitive phenomena and paracausality.
## [[Älwathend Witafjürgen|Leombjürna's]] Laws of Engrams

1. An [[Engram|engram]], herein as it is defined, is any process which controls [[soulfire]] for some purpose. Thermodynamically, it is any process which influences state evolution (entropy) by the paracausal control of [[soulfire]].

2. It is impossible for an [[engram]], its effect, or its target to travel faster than light and/or causality. Time travel is therefore impossible under all circumstances.

3. It is impossible for an [[engram]] to permanently remove information. Information about what an [[engram]] accomplished is contained in the [[Soulfire#Sparks|sparks]] it generates and the [[Flamescript|flamescript]] left behind.

4. It's impossible for an [[engram]] to change, create, remove, or ignore an engrammatic law.

### Practical Limitations

Of all the [[Consciousness|sapients]] on Aliffrüme, an estimated 3.4% are capable of resonating with [[Gimyndine#^4fb5c9|purestones]] or better. Gimyns below this grade are unsuitable for little but carrying personal cargo unless mass resonance–a technique indigenous and restricted to the raincatcher Áren–is performed. Given the difficulty and danger of maintaining a resonant state, using singular stones for long periods of time is impractical. Combined with the rarity of purestones, this means that resonant [[firekeeping]] is rarely used for individual concerns, and is most often utilized in industry and national defense. 
   
Blackfire devices are, though limited in scope and portability, relatively common, given how easy ashstone dust is to produce. This is how most machinery is powered within industrial centers, though it sees little use in rural areas given the dangers of contamination.

On the flip side, though [[Soulkeeping|soulkeeping]] is equally accessible to any and all, the practice requires intense discipline, self-reflection, and overall dedication to produce measurable results. This results in intense specialization, where those who have little or no reason to utilize it do not, leaving a select few who dedicate their lives to it.


### Flamescript

A core part of firekeeping's advancement as a practice is the cataloging and sharing of discoveries and techniques. This is accomplished through the creation of flamescript, otherwise termed as scriptcraft. Scriptcraft, the process by which [[The Phlogistic Model#Engrams|engrams]] are created, shared, and improved upon, is one of the most vital components of firekeeping; especially gimyndine firekeeping. It begins with transcription, the process of creating an engram and encoding it into reality as flamescript.

Transcription begins with a flamescribe coating a chosen medium in their lightfire—be it soul, gimyn, or black—as this will be where the engram they create will be encoded. They then enter a meditative state of visualization, which is described to occur in three stages:

1. **Conceptualization** \- The initial "brainstorming" of an engram, setting down required effects, inputs, and structure. The overall figure is fuzzy, but the start and end can be identified.  
2. **Redefinition** \- In this stage, the concept is refined and fleshed out. Individual logics are settled upon, minor conflicts are resolved, and processes are made more efficient.  
3. **Crystallization** \- Up until this point, the mind of the flamescribe has never conceived the engram in full. With everything settled, the entire engram is visualized at once, and the lightfire collapses into a unique pattern encoding the engram, not dissimilar to a waveform collapsing to a single version.

Upon completion of this process, the lightfire will infuse upon the surface in a unique construction with varying amounts of spin. From this point onwards, lightfire which contacts the infused flamescript takes on the form of the encoded engram automatically, while remaining under the infuser’s control. The manipulation of an active engram and lightfire is a separate skill, however, and left to scriptlighters.

It should be noted that if a flamescribe possesses sufficient skill, the process of transcription can occur with much less than complete focus, and flamescript can be encoded briefly upon the body, allowing for scripts to be "remembered" in the short term.

The form of flamescript varies heavily, due to their origin in the myriad thoughts of sapients. Those engraved using dyed gimynfire contain idiosyncratic circular patterns, the system used by the Hytheans to describe reality in mathematical notation. Flamescript burned by a natural [[firekeeper]] or luciant, on the other hand, takes on a more chaotic and inconsistent shape that carries an uncanny beauty nonetheless.

### Vestiges

Of note is the peculiar connection between engrams and the mental states of their authors. When one is realizing an engram, they are guided through the emotions and thoughts the flamescribe felt when conceiving the engram. Experienced flamescribes can even witness flamescript and immediately intuit the mental state of its creator at the time. This can be guarded against with conscious effort by the flamescribe during the engraving process, but doing so detracts from the quality of the work.

Conversely, the more intimate a relationship the scriptlighter has with the flamescript's author, the more effectively they can utilize the engram. The best current theory posits that the greater ability to simulate the author's mind and decisions–derived from the greater understanding of their thought process and, at  the very least, typical response to stimuli–allows them to more effectively enact their envisioned effect.

As a result, lighting or reading another's genuine flamescript is considered a rather intimate act, and is the reason many scriptlighters marry their flamescribes. The heightened intimacy leads both to the flamescribe hiding less of their true selves and contributing to the quality of the engram, and to the scriptlighter being able to more efficiently employ the engram crafted by the flamescribe.


## Gimyndine
Gimyndine \[gih-men-dean] is a naturally occurring opal-like material commonly seen accumulating on and around areas of high [[Infusion|infusion]], and is notable for it's ability to produce a distinct form of [[Soulfire]]--appropriately called [[Soulfire#Gimynfire|gimynfire]]--upon various forms of interaction.

Different colors and crystal formations of gimyndine are known to have different soulfire outputs and ease-of-use, which influences which type a prospecting scriptlighter might choose. Generally, the most powerful crystals have vibrant hues with stunning patterns, but are also exceedingly rare. Each grade is also split into “low” and “high” (e.g. “high kingstone” and “low palestone”) for further granularity, and to nicely align the ranking to base 12.

### Ashstone

Commonly referred to as simply “ash” or “dust," ashstone is the lowest grade of gimyndine, and the most common. Simply a dull black or other exceedingly dark color all within and without; not a hint of honesty. It is also by far the majority component in making gimpowder, as its only practical use.  

Recent research has suggested that, rather than a mined mineral, ashstone is a human byproduct in some way. It is most commonly found encrusting surfaces where humans or dense life gather, as opposed to buried underground or strewn about ruins. A common theory is that it's actually a localized crystallization of soulfire from ambient life, where the high density coagulates with little available matter to couple, and so instead “precipitates” into physicality.

### Dullstone

A middle ground between blackstone and palestone, though often simply blackstone with patches of dark color. Typically used to make mid-quality gimpowder.

### Palestone

The common grade of gimyndine, with a pale hue and a monotone pattern. Often granted to scriptlighters in training or those of low standing, but still preferable to being unable to use firekeeping.

### Purestone

The advanced grade of gimyndine, possessing vibrant colors but no play-of-color. The standard for professional scriptlighters and high-grade military equipment. ^4fb5c9

### Blazestone

The elite grade of gimyndine, possessing a hue that seems to glow with play-of-color, and maintains a persistent halo of sparks. Often the centerpiece of a renowned scriptlighter's arsenal.

### Kingstone

The highest grade of gimyndine, and so named because its power and rarity allow those in possession of one and the skills to use it to found nations. Even single toes of kingstone are regarded as world-class and fetch prices that rival entire estates. Physically, they resemble high-grade black opals with vibrant colors and patterns.   
As of the writing of this encyclopedia, there are thought to be only 3 complete statues of kingstone in the world. Curiously, they have only been found as unbroken, completely whole objects in ruins, as opposed to shattered and piecemeal like other varieties. 

### The Skull of Vakatow

The largest and most powerful specimen of gimyndine in the world. It was discovered in the depths of a Kishian ruin, and is currently in the possession of the Ayangatalan royal family for powering their infamous “Scarlet Sky” city-scale defense engram. The skull itself has been encased mostly in a large tungsten sphere to protect those near from the burning intensity of its sparks.

### Gimyndine

Gimyndine is not the only source of [[Soulfire|soulfire]], but an extremely important one. Soulfire is also generated by every living thing, and with practice this soulfire generation can be increased. Compared to an unpracticed sapient, however, gimyndine is many times more powerful when resonating. Of note is that soulfire produced by gimyndine is referred to as gimynfire, as its properties are unique enough to warrant differentiation.

Gimyndine is divided into two distinct classes, dyed and undyed. Undyed gimyndine, or ashtone, is noted to accrue over time in any area dense with soulfire. Meanwhile, dyed gimyndine is only attested as far back as 0 AL, and is not mentioned in any Hythean records discovered to date. So far, the cause of this is unknown.

In order to utilize dyed gimyndine as a steady source of gimynfire, it must be sufficiently resonated with. This process involves a user packing their own thoughts, beliefs, and emotions into a metaphorical box, causing their soulfire to become colorless. When this colorless soulfire overlaps with a gimyn (a sample of gimyndine), a stoneshade will manifest, often a similar personality to the resonator. The resonator must calmly convince the shade to bond with them, often done by compromising beliefs and personality traits present during resonance. Upon completion, a resonator may choose to activate the gimyn any time it is sufficiently near to them, which will result in their ability to wield gimynfire and the agreed upon mental shift. Some individuals, most notably the copperleaf tribes, are unable to resonate with gimyndine due to their naturally resistant constitutions.

For bursts of gimynfire, gimyndine can be put under intense compressive pressures which vary based on the color of the crystal. Upon crossing the breakpoint, a gimynfire burst of a corresponding intensity will expand out from the crystal, destroying it. This pressure is often higher than its shear strength, so it can be sliced into a fine powder for easier transport at the cost of efficiency.

### Stoneshades

Referring to a few different phenomena, the primary use of the term “stoneshade” is to refer to the eerie “personality” gimyndine samples and their gimynfire seem to possess. This necessitates one of the major components of scriptlighting and resonating, the ability to shift one’s thought processes to be more in-line with any particular sample. The principle skill of the scriptlighter, then, can be said to be acting.

Another use of the term stoneshade, in many ways identical, is to refer to the actual personality that scriptlighters assume when resonating that may sometimes overcome them. The principal danger of scriptlighting–aside, of course, from glassrot–is in the domination of a stoneshade over a scriptlighter's ego as a result of over-reliance on one gimyn. This process is naturally very distressing, though the afflicted are often incapable of recognizing their own changes. Once a stoneshade fully takes over, the afflicted is rendered unable to use any other gimyn.

There are also rare cases where a stoneshade may take on a physical presence in reality in the form of an autonomous soulfire field, called a **descension**. Descensions have been noticed to occur most frequently when a glassrote scriptlighter goes through significant emotional distress during a resonation, causing an immediate rejection of the lighter as a soulfire controller but still requiring the gimynfire be controlled. In this case, what is thought to be the scriptlighter's own shade takes control of the cloud and causes general destruction until forcibly dispersed.

Due to the consequences of stoneshades, one of the cornerstones of a [[Flamebearer|flamebearer]]'s skill is the ability to successfully resonate with many different samples. This is especially paramount in the modern religious climate, eager to differentiate themselves from the “demonic tyrants” of the past and their “haunted” actions.


### Coalescence

An attractive force occurring whenever [[Soulfire]] ([[Infusion|infused]] or uninfused) draws near infused soulfire with a higher [[Spin Friction|spin]]. Spun, infused soulfire in the pattern of an [[Engram]], also known as [[flamescript]], has the property of bending uninfused soulfire along with its pattern, manifesting the effects of the engram within the flamescript. Put another way, spun soulfire pulls nearby free soulfire into its shape, often imparting some kind of energy on matter along the path as it infuses. Highly soulfire-efficient, but highly complex and prone to unexplainable errors. Practically, this allows for the creation of soulfire currents and energy manipulation without conscious intention.


### Combustion

A reaction that occurs whenever [[Coupling|infused]] [[Soulfire]] is suddenly compressed, which consumes soulfire directly as an energy source. The result is an instantaneous outward pressure on the infused matter, destruction of the involved soulfire, and the generation of [[Conscious Plane|conscious waves]]. The specific amount of soulfire consumed depends upon the magnitude of the shock and the fluidity of the medium. More pressure leads to a bigger combustion, while more fluid soulfire absorbs shock more easily. Simple and potent, it is utilized to great effect in certain styles of martial arts and explosive weapons.

### Reactive Combustion

One consequence of [[coupling]] is so-called reactive combustion, the logical consequence of [[combustion]] happening during sudden compression of [[Soulfire]] and coupling’s gathering of significant quantities of infused soulfire. The principal concept is that, upon two coupled objects colliding at speed, a certain amount of soulfire annihilates in a combustion reaction. This results in the less massive object being partially decoupled and launched backwards, and the more massive object being drained of an equal amount of soulfire and similarly pushed back.

Due to this annihilation reaction, flamebearer's armor is often coupled for the sole purpose of deterring repeated attacks by a small projectile, allowing for an easy capture if it is attempted regardless. This makes pinpoint weapons–such as bullets and arrows–less feasible as coupled implements, as controlling enough of them to eventually drain the armor of soulfire would require complex engrams and be a waste of gimynfire.

As a result, lightweight flamebearers are geared towards fighting unarmored infantrymen, and heavyweight scriptlighters are best at fighting other scriptlighters. To defeat armor, a large single weapon is needed, and to counterbalance that weight, heavy armor is also needed. As opposed to a lightweight flamebearer, who relies on inhuman acrobatic maneuvering to dodge attacks, heavyweights rely on their immense force and mass.

A unique use of this interaction is in tournament duels, where each contestant is supplied a breastplate to charge with soulfire, and their pick of weapon. The first to have their breastplate wholly drained loses. This is particularly safe because even if a plate with minimal charge left is hit with a full attack, the attack is repelled enough to at least cancel the momentum.

It is worth noting that just because coupling is the most common cause of reactive combustion, it can also happen with any sufficient density and collision speed of opposing soulfire. For example, an artery’s dagger coated in cycling blood, when colliding with a shade's immaterial flesh, might cause a number of minor combustions that excavate the wound.


### Coupling

Coupling is a phenomenon wherein [[Spin Friction|spun]], [[Infusion|infused]] [[Soulfire]] augments the structure of a material, significantly raising its structural integrity and causing it to become a natural attractor of soulfire, as well as allowing direct control of the matter through conscious force, while preserving conservation of momentum by imparting equal and opposite momentum on the coupler. Traditionally organic matter– such as carbon, oxygen, and other light elements–is easier to impart soulfire into, although it takes a much lower concentration to [[gimyndization|gimyndize]] it. On the other end, heavy metals have much higher coupling breakpoints, but can hold a coupling for much longer.

Coupling is gradually worn down over time with spin decay, and needs to be spun anew to maintain the same responsiveness and upper limit to force. Due to the workings of coupling, the bodies of nearly every living being are naturally coupled to some degree. Since molecular bonds are enhanced by coupling, this grants a natural durability to those high in soulfire, and even allows them to manipulate more force through their body with delicate soulfire control. Taking gimynfire into the body like this is possible, but it induces rapid [[gimyndization]] and gradually increasing pain.

---

In modern firekeeping, coupling is the main method by which martial flamebearers achieve their effects, with more complex effects generally not worth the cost from abstraction drag, or the time investment to remove said drag. In this regard, the main action of martial scriptlighting is the coupling and manipulation of nearby matter, supplemented with automated routines or reactions inscribed into kindlegems as flamescript.

An important mechanic of coupling lies in its forceful removal, called a challenge. According to the Rule of Proximity–which states that control of soulfire gets inverse squarely more difficult as the distance from the source increases–when a rival scriptlighter is closer to a coupled object than the original coupler, they can challenge the coupling by attempting to forcefully infuse their own soulfire and override the existing coupling. If successful, they capture the coupled object for their own manipulation. Materials with a higher coupling breakpoint are naturally more difficult to challenge, and certain objects are even impossible to couple unless some condition is dealt with.

---

Notably, coupled objects are indistinguishable from others, except by the way they reflect sparks like an iridescent shimmer. This is used to great effect in various martial disciplines, throwing fake knives to hide the coupled one from a challenge. The dominant color of the shimmer depends upon the color of the soulfire possessing it, and the saturation on the amount.


### Infusion

Perhaps the most basic interaction, [[Soulfire]] undergoes infusion when it’s radially compressed by [[Conscious Plane|the Conscious Plane]], shunting it down into the physical realm. This process also generates a form of radiation called [[Soulfire#Sparks|sparks]], in order to preserve the information lost in converting continuous soulfire to quantized reality. Only infused soulfire is capable of directly interacting with matter or the physical forces.

| Soulfire | Uninfused | Infused |
| -------- | --------- | ------- |
| Unspun   | Cognition | Field   |
| Spun     | Memory    | Coupled |



### Spin Friction

Similar to particle physics, the “spin” of [[Soulfire|soulfire]] refers to, in a sense, its angular momentum. Spin is imparted upon [[Infusion|infused]] soulfire through the addition of a twisting force to radial compression, and higher spin soulfire has the property of a higher “static friction” when infused. That is, it “sticks” better before an applied [[Intention Field|conscious force]] detaches it. The main limitation of many kinematic systems involving [[The Phlogistic Model|phlogistics]] is the magnitude of this spin friction, as it limits the upper bound of force that can be applied reliably, thus limiting the weight of manipulable objects.


## Phantasms

A curious form of life born of [[Soulfire]], phantasms come into existence and are sustained by the aggregate [[Soul|halo]] of [[Consciousness|sentients]] forming around certain places, ideas, or even people.

### Wisps

### Eidolons

### Dragons

### Shades



### Soul Assertion

A technique wherein [[Soulfire]] is, in a way, infused through the soul plane, producing results in alignment with the [[Soul]]’s view of itself. A unique feature of [[Soulkeeping|soulkeepers]], it serves as an invaluable method of healing from injury and illness. However, it requires a number of components to function. 

Chiefly, the user must be relatively attuned to the topology of their soul, which means an extensive knowledge of the self. Secondarily, an image of the state one wishes to assert, subconsciously or otherwise. This notably limits what can be done for chronic ailments and subtly slow transformations.

---

Soul assertion can also be performed on a foreign target, provided they’re at least subconsciously willing. In this case, a skilled practitioner can much more easily feel an external soul, and supply them with harmonic soulfire by empathizing with their current state. Though, naturally, this will never be as powerful as if the target had learned for themselves.

## Notable Objects

### Emrall’s Army

The colloquial term for the destroyed supermassive ring of Hythean-era satellites surrounding Aliffrüme. As they travel across the sky, they resemble millions of faint emerald glimmers shooting across the heavens, one of many reasons for the association of the color green with holiness and divinity.


## Animal Species

### Whale-eaters

A species of large beasts living in the Strait of Hellas and the Spired Sea which feed on stone-crawlers on the ocean floor, and gradually go mad from the gimyndine in the crawlers before surfacing to hunt crest-whales. The creatures resemble a kind of gargantuan mer-wolf, and are harvested for their large hauls of high-quality [[Gimyndine]] and other useful materials, forming the backbone of the [[Llantakúna#Yejian|Yejian]] economy and power system.  

Naturally, the creatures vary in size and behavior, with the largest being capable of threatening cities. But as the size rises, so too does the haul, and thus many Yejian [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] have made a career around hunting the creatures and innovating novel techniques such as the rolling couple to help conquer water and, by extension, the creatures.

### Shimmer-beasts

The name for a large group of predators native to copperleaf forests, which are capable of harnessing ambient [[Soulfire]] for their own [[Engram|engrams]], and which typically possesses a [[Flamescript]]-like intuitive iridescence, from which they get their name. They are the only natural predators of the [[Kuthjïuman#Kaithurhi|Kaithurhi]], and are very difficult to defeat without adequate preparation.

### Armored Branchlight

One of the iconic species native to the [[Halisan#Arenfürich|Arenfürich]] rainforest, it resembles a stark gray tree pangolin with gold vertical stripes all along its body. They are relatively large to be able to generate sufficient body heat, around 20 inches from head to body with a further 28 inches of tail. Their claws and undertail are covered in a white rubbery material similar to [[Kuthjïuman#Áren|Áren]] rainward, which allows them excellent grip even on the wet bark of the canopy.  

Their diet consists chiefly of slickwood mites, a hive insect that make their homes in hollowed out [[Plant Species#Slickwood Tree|slickwood trees]]. They clean the trees of these pests, and in return the trees retain one or two empty branches for the creatures to hang from.  

Their native habitat thus lies among the bulbs of the slickwood tree. When not hunting, they will hang from an empty branch and roll themselves into a ball and use firekeeping to have their stripes glow, camouflaging themselves as one of the glowing amber orbs.

### Canopy Longnose

The main pollinator of [[Halisan#Arenfürich|Arenfürich]], they resemble lemurs with exceptionally long noses suited to nectar-hunting, and long rainward tails suited to grasping wet branches. Various species cater to the various flowering trees of the rainforest, dashing among the upper canopy with the aid of powerful legs and a light frame. For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as skippers. Some common species include the wine-back, the redcoat, and the gold-glow.  

One especially common species of longnose is the feathered longnose, known for the waterproof sheen of its dark feathers. Some time ago, the áren nobility were able to domesticate and breed the species to possess beautiful streaks of bright red, blue, magenta, cyan, violet, and gold. It is one of the more common pets for a noblewoman, favored for its restrained beauty with streaks of enticing emotion and vibrancy.

### Domestic Rivertail

A large lizard-like reptilian species originally domesticated as fishing partners in [[Halisan#Arenfürich|Arenfürich]], they have since been bred into many different variants. Most warrior's breeds range around the height of large dogs, about 3.5 feet in height and 6 feet from head to hind, with 4 feet of tail. They tend to be colored deep brown and red, the latter being bred as the color of valor.  

Ornamental breeds are much smaller, being under a foot off the ground with 1 foot of body and 1 foot of tail, but possess vibrant colors and various exaggerated features. These are favored by non-combat noblemen, advertising their compassion through the breed's unique playfulness, in addition to guarding against pickpockets and being a nice shoulder piece.

### Lowland Plateback

 A large amphibious reptile resembling a mix between a whale shark and turtle, which uses its large size to sit comfortably in the rivers of [[Halisan#Arenfürich|Arenfürich]], breathing through a hole on the top of its shell and filter feeding the abundant cyanobacteria and algae.

### Swarmswatch

A small, camouflaging, reptilian pollinator. Also called hues.



## Biological Conventions

### Photosynthesis

Life on Aliffrüme evolved under a violet-peaking sun. This means that purple, specifically bacteriorhodopsin won out as the dominant color to photosynthesize with during early evolutionary stages. Plants which utilize this photosynthesis method don't need much water, since the bacteriorhodopsin reaction is extremely simple and doesn't use water or produce oxygen.

### Pneumivorosity

Through the utilization of various porphyrin-based pigments, certain plants are able to consume soulfire for various effects. Most common is as a replacement for photosynthetic pigments, allowing the organism to grow much larger and without reliance on sunlight. Less common is to directly drive the ATP cycle, although this method is unsuited to droughts of soulfire or fluctuations in its intensity.

### Sex and Epigenetics

Biological sex for sentient species is handled somewhat differently from the majority of other true species, due to global distribution yet frequent mingling and intense radiation. The “species” of a sentient is something like a second sex chromosome pair. Consider the following case:  
An Áren male and Yejian female, both homogenous, have children. Any males born would be Áren, with a recessive Yejian encoding. Any females born would be Yejian, with a recessive Áren encoding. Intersex children or other genetic deviations tend to result in infertile hybrids, due to the volatility of the system.  
Note that these results depend on species group, not race. Thus, an Áren and Muintaferan could give birth to children of either gender and race. Additionally, if both have a recessive encoding for the same species, it’s possible their children may be born of that species instead.

### Sentient “Species”

The different “species” of sentients are actually more similar to a multitude of different subspecies groups for two or three species, as intense radiation has spurred rapid specialization and adaptation to the varied environments of Aliffrüme. The four known are the Llantakúna,  Kuthjïuman, Tiangengzhe, and Zäkhisny. There are, however, many ill-substantiated reports of a peculiar tall-eared race hidden among the glaciers of the southern continent, often referred to as the Rokajun.



A most-often acquired, though also congenital, condition which entails a total inability to form [[Engram|engrams]], [[Flamescript|flamescript]], or any other kind of mental picture. For unknown reasons, this grants the afflicted an almost superhuman resistance to the various disadvantages of [[Gimyndine|gimyndine]]. Most notably, aphantasiacs will no longer go mad from extended gimyndine resonance, nor suffer identity death or gimyndization.  

Aphantasia is often acquired by uncautious scriptlighters as a result of over-reliance on kindlegems, and they are subsequently rendered unable to use anything but. Almost as a trade-off, however, aphantasiacs gain the ability to effortlessly draw out and shape gimynfire in enormous quantities, if with limited precision.   

For this reason, some may even seek out aphantasia to chase simple, raw, overwhelming power with coupling. A number of militaries and terrorist organizations have experimented with inducing aphantasia after a subject has suffered identity death, resulting in a mindless soldier with an impenetrable gimynfire barrier and titanic coupling strength. The practice is naturally considered extremely immoral and cruel, and is considered an abominable war crime by many peoples and nations.




A congenital mental condition thought to occur from a unique brain structure paradigm as opposed to non-lucent individuals, often resulting in difficulties interacting with [[Gimyndine|gimyndine]] and foreign [[Soulfire|soulfire]] in general, though also affording great intuition for intuitive phenomena and logical reasoning. In particular, many lucent individuals are renowned as talented computers.


## Corporeal Immortality

Though never truly unkillable, life has a few different ways of obtaining what might be called immortality. The most common form, being “eternal,” refers to the body no longer requiring external energy and forgoing senescence. Truer immortals, called “spirits,” are able to maintain consciousness as a detached soul and produce intense soulfire, allowing them to generate material bodies autonomously as forms of woven soulfire. However, they can be prevented from doing so via sealing methods. In a special case, phantasms which become spirits are called “dragons."

/\* Note for later: add section explaining magic lifeform evolutionary path of coalescence \-\> phantasm \-\> dragon to…somewhere\*/

### Ouroboran

Named for a Hythean mythological figure, the beginning of all natural eternals is an Ouroboran state. This is achieved through maintaining delicate control over a high level of soulfire, such that one is continually regenerating their form while infusing such a density as to rapidly mutate their cells. Thus, the body’s genetic code fluctuates until a variety that can tolerate the improved density appears. Even better, eventually, one may appear that can use infused soulfire for energy. Given the genetic information can be stored in the soul and regeneration is constant, aging is slowed to a halt. Meanwhile, soulfire supplants consumption. Thus, eternity.

### Induced Eternity

At the peak of the Hythean era, it’s believed nearly every [[Firekeeper|firekeeper]] alive was artificially eternal, as records from the lower classes describe their lifespans stretching for grandcycles and undergoing a notable change after some ritual tradition. Records from the Hytheans, meanwhile, indicate a routine medical procedure performed during adulthood supplanted common genetic machinery using material from something called the Progenitrix.   

Further investigation in recent years has led to the discovery of the exact process, which utilizes the genetic material of the Progenitrix, the first Hythean [[firekeeper]] to maintain an Ouroboran state for long enough to produce results, producing cells that naturally harvested soulfire to produce energy.  

To undergo this process, one must be subject to the incredibly complex and soulfire-intensive Rite of Transcendence. This engram is what actually replaces all the relevant biological machinery with soulfire-powered substitutes, essentially being genetic engineering through firekeeping.  

Because of the monogenetic nature of this kind of eternal, they all share common traits based on their gender (the first eternal was female, and if introduced to a male would induce an unwanted sex change. Luckily modification of the genome was successful in this regard.) Women gain brilliant marble hair, while men acquire three consecutive birthmarks under their left eye.

### Natural Eternals

In the Nebvoltsi and Altakhu, there are a few cases of individuals becoming eternal without a special ritual. In this case, their uniquely high soulfire generation, even among eternals, resulted in an unintentional extended, slow Ouroboran that ultimately produced favorable soulfire-consuming variants naturally.

### Consequences of Eternity

The process of becoming eternal also alters the genetic code, such that any children one has will be born partially or fully eternal, depending on the other parent. This seems good at first glance, but a child cannot possibly know themselves and thus cannot produce ample soulfire, which means that any child not fully in control of their emotions runs the risk of starving parts of their body if not in an environment artificially filled with soulfire harmonic to theirs.  

In addition, becoming eternal makes one exceptionally susceptible to disharmonic disorder, meaning that they cannot directly activate gimyndine themselves and find being near it rather uncomfortable. This makes them effectively unable to utilize gimyndine, forcing them to be wholly reliant on their own soulfire generation only.



## Familial Genetics

### Eye Color 

The eye color of a sentient being is incredibly complex, due to a structurally-colored array of pigments being best at deterring [[Soulfire#Sparks|sparks]]. One gene controls lycopene, one controls lipochrome. Notably, the yellow pigment is polar, and pushed into flakes when lycopene is present

| More of either pigment means higher clarity spark sight. | PP (Deep gold)                         |  Pp (A little yellow)  | pp (No yellow, blue light from Rayleigh scattering) |
| :------------------------------------------------------: | -------------------------------------- | :--------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
|                      LL (Dark red)                       | Garnet (Flakes of bright red and gold) | Wine (Flakes of gold)  |                      Amethyst                       |
|                      Ll (Some red)                       | Flame (Flakes of gold)                 | Azure (Flakes of gold) |                      Raspberry                      |
|  ll (No red, blue from rayleigh, result \= light blue)   | Honey                                  |         Green          |                        Blue                         |

### Hair Color

Hair color in [[Consciousness]] is provided mainly by anthocyanins, although guanine powder remains from the skin. The specific anthocyanins are malvidin and cyanidin. The mixture of these, combined with lightening/sparkling by guanine, defines hair color. While hair color is far more of a spectrum than eye color, ranging the whole anthocyanin range of [red to violet to blue, as well as orange and black](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joel-Ochieng/publication/236146371/figure/fig1/AS:442498356125697@1482511237792/Visible-color-range-of-common-anthocyanidins.png) (a notable hereditary mutation is the production of pelargonidin, producing orange and brown hues), a chart is still useful as some variants are dominant. One gene controls the acidity of the hair, while the other controls whether cyanidin is manufactured or not. Additionally, the below chart only indicates hues. The pigment density can affect the apparent color.

| Note: Hair color follows much more of a "gradient" pattern. This is more of a guideline as to what colors are possible. |    AA (Basic pH)     |      Aa (Neutral pH)      |      aa (Acidic pH)       |

## Intuition

Many cultures recognize the existence of a “sixth sense,” the ability to intuit emotions and sensations from soulfire-related phenomena, generally referred to as intuition. Other cultures may include it under [[pneumasensitivity]], but the main reason for its separation is intuition’s ability to act without the overt presence of [[Soulfire#Sparks|sparks]] or [[Flamescript]], as in cases of simply “feeling” emotion in the other senses; this can include the love in a touch, the anger in a glare, or the anxiety in music. Essentially, since it can be part of synesthesia, it is separate.


## Pigmentation

There are two main methods of protecting against sparks: Reflection by a lattice of guanine and collagen, or absorption by anthocyanins.

* **Guanine** \- Present in spark sensing organs, the hair and fur of many fauna, and [[Consciousness#Schausen|Schausen]] skin. Can be many colors, but most often is a glittering white.

* **Anthocyanins** \- Present as hair pigmentation in many lifeforms, often as some shade of purple for better camouflage among the leaves of bacteriorhodopsin-dyed purple plants. Also serves to protect the brain from pixies, psychedelic hallucinations caused by sparks that can cause long-term mental damage.

  * **NOTE** \- Astaxanthin is proven to be a lipid-soluble pigment, can be blue and red to make purple. Anthocyanin is preferable because it is single-compound and easily available, but not proven uptakeable.

* **Photosynthetic** \- Bacteriorhodopsin (a purple photosynthetic) is the main photosynthesis system on





## Plant Species

### Goldwood

A semi-uncommon flowering tree native to the copperleaf forests around the Assurian Crater. It serves as the [[Gimyndine]] purifier for the ecosystem, housing a varied ecology of pneumivorous bacteria and an expansive rhizome root system. Purified [[Soulfire|gimynfire]] precipitates out of the roots and into the soil of the forest, favoring near-to-ground plants and coating the forest in a blanket of sky-blue ivy and golden-white fog-like [[Soulfire]].

Paper made from thin slices of goldwood is naturally infused, and thus noted for its ability to hold [[Flamescript]] indefinitely. It is used widely in the art of intuitive storytelling practiced by the native [[Llantakúna#Nebvoltsi|Nebvoltsi]] and [[Llantakúna#Ayauitlaka|Ayauitlaka]], and remains a major export to foreign [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] without [[Kindlegem|kindlegems]] or having traditional tastes.

### Pelygwyr

A rare flowering vine native to the Kanthyna forest, noted for its emerald green petals and the glowing gold patterns upon them. It is regarded as a holy flower by the tribes of the Eldwyth, a gift that breathes life into the forest with its light.

It is known to grow on and around outcroppings of gimyndine, absorbing and metabolizing all the discordant soulfire and sparks and emitting a pure golden-white soulfire. This golden soulfire is what all the fotivorous flora of the forest feed on, and what the firekeeping fauna utilize for their engrams. Therefore, the health of the Pelygwyr population is central to the health of the entire forest.

The main pigment used in the process is turacoverdin, but the foundations of the process are present in numerous species of the ***dissoarchaea*** genus. These algae each absorb a differing spectrum of the gimyndine’s soulfire individually, use a little of its energy, then re-emit it with a wavelength proportionally shortened. As each cell removes less and less energy, the soulfire is eventually fully harmonized and purified. With no further energy extractable by the ***dissoarchaea*** it escapes through dedicated openings (the pattern) as a golden-white glow.

### Ringroot

A rhizomal vine native to Arenfürich which grows extremely thick shoots in circling patterns, forming natural circular enclosures which gather rainwater into areas of standing water suitable for plant growth. When the plants die, they sink to the bottom and form nutrient-rich soil for the ringroot. The various forms of ringroot are cultivated by the Áren as natural crop containers, and their fruits are sometimes eaten in times of famine.

### Slickwood Tree

A towering lamptree native to Arenfürich that inhabits the rainier areas, where other trees would erode or lack root systems. The tree is known for producing an extremely hydrophobic epicuticular wax all along the bark and leaves, especially its upper leaves, to guard against the heavy rain. The native Àren cultivate the tree for this wax, which is used in the making of many of their products and sells for a high price in foreign lands. The wax itself is valued for its ability to be easily mixed in with a wood finish, polish, and even some oil-based dyes, all while retaining its properties.

The size and thickness of each tree is immense, even by rainforest standards. The trees can grow as tall as 120 feet, with trunks as thick as 10 feet. The thickness is necessary to store sufficient sap for the Arenfürich winters, where all rainfall ceases for 10 weeks. The roots can grow as thick as 12 feet in places, while sprawling out as far as 100 feet. Uniquely, the roots grow halfway above ground perpendicular to the local water flow so as to build up piles of sediment for feeding.

Given the protective nature of these large trees, many plants and animals flourish under their canopy. Various vines, mosses, and lichens make root on their trunks, and the pollinating longnose lemurs enjoy eating the nourishing nectar from the slickwood bellflowers.

### Animarchaea (Genus)

A genus of fotivorous prokaryotes that harvest energy from harmonic soulfire through the use of various porphyrin-based pigments. These species are found almost exclusively in the rivers of Hynawyll Valley, with certain species becoming dominant in each of the 9-dyed Rivers, which truly number 6\. The species inhabiting the lower 6 (fork) rivers, ***coccineum***, ***aurantineum***, ***flauvineum***, ***prasineum***, ***cayaneum***, and ***caeruelineum*** glow the “lower” colors of Eldwyn culture. These form pairs into the 3 higher (combined) rivers, which host ***violaneum***, ***roseneum***, and ***vinineum***; the 3 “holy colors” of the Eldywth tribes. These all finally combine into the 10th Holy River, which hosts innumerable species and glows an ethereal white.

These species use the energy harvested to do many things, but the primary two are to power a proton pump and to generate a defensive barrier; the barrier being necessary for maintaining cellular structure without undergoing lysis in the intense environment. The bacteria are also able to subtly adjust their barriers and soulfire absorption spectra to harmonize with each other or other life. This can lead to large blooms in soulfire rivers, and is also utilized in the Kaithurhi’s symbiotic relationship with certain species.



## Pneumasensitivity

Every sentient being on Aliffrüme has some level of pneumasensitivity, or the ability to sense and/or feel [[Soulfire|soulfire]] and [[Soulfire#Sparks|sparks]]. Organs that provide this sense are called pneumasensors, and typically resemble rod or cone cells but with guanine lattices instead of modified retinal discs. These organs come in two types:
### Pyrrhoreceptors

A type of specialized neuron found in all living creatures that can determine how much soulfire it holds, serving numerous purposes throughout the body. The most relevant, however, is in the ears. When macro-scale vibrations in the conscious plane push against the [[Soul|halo]], the reaction “shunts” some soulfire to [[Infusion|infuse]] nearby matter, which can be detected by sensitive pyrrhoreceptors. 

In this way, a sense of soulfire “hearing” is created by placing pyrrhoreceptors through the halo’s border, allowing for the detection of organic movement and especially the usage of soulfire. It also works as a unique identifier for an individual, like a second voice. Due to their nature, these sensors are often found in the ear tips, and a heightened sensitivity requires the lengthening of the ears, allowing for the detection of longer wavelengths.

However, a heightened sensitivity means a higher risk of muting or damaging the receptors in soulfire-dense environments, especially with the limited protection cartilage provides. Thus some species that evolved in these soulfire-dense environments, such as the [[Kuthjïuman#Kaithurhi|Kaithurhi]], instead grow dedicated horns of modified bone surrounded in collagen. The bone, in addition to holding marrow, protects strips of pyrrhoreceptors that grant excellent directional hearing at the cost of sensitivity.

### Sparkcatchers

A type of neuron found in sentient creatures, able to detect sparks, with a similar structure to rod cells. Though soulfire can be detected through the intuitive extensions of the 5 main senses, sparks exist in the material plane and thus necessitate specialized sensors. Detecting sparks allows for an early warning system against firekeeping predators, with many sentients even learning to predict the movements of others and even the effects of engrams based upon the timing and distribution of sparks.


### Consciousness on Aliffrüme
A sapient species, generally, is any intelligent species which has successfully developed a [[Soul|soul]], thus achieving a certain level of self-awareness and higher cognition. 

Consciousness lies on a scale. However, there is an important distinction to be made. *Sapience* is used to delineate a state of higher awareness (where "sentience" might be used commonly), whereas *consciousness* instead means an understanding of one’s sentience, a sort of peace with and awareness of one’s own inner workings. Consciousness is low in the denialists, the troubled, and the uncertain. Meanwhile it is high in the wise, the accepting, and the understanding.


## Kuthjïuman
A Halanian species, the [[Glossary#^69f8b6|Kuthjïuman]] have their origins in the superfarms that inhabited the continent in the Hythean era, and as such have a number of key features to assist in that role. Their most stand-out feature is their rainwards, organs that cover their limbs and other parts of the body, taking in the hard rainwater and converting it to a rough, guarded, natural armor. Their ears have been similarly hardened into horns, bioluminescent at the tips to prevent losing members under the waters, which also glow brighter in the presence of sparks as an early-warning sign. Aside from that, their traits are mostly internal, including largely reworked muscular, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems to account for a large size and larger calorie intake.   

A notable consequence of Halanian's lack of contact with gimyndine is much stronger cases of glassröt, and a great difficulty in resonating with it. This has changed in modern times with the arrival of trade with gimyndine-using races, but is still a disadvantage. The flip of this, of course, means that the strongest luciants to be found are Halanian, helped along by their strong systems.

### Áren

%%Instead of producing an oil, Kuthjïuman rainwards are simply areas of reptilian-like scales which act to prevent the person from drying out or suffering water damage. This gives a natural reason for it to cover their legs, lower arms, upper torso and back.%%

A Kuthjïuman native to the Arenfürich rainforest, which focuses on the growth of completely water-inundated crops. They are notably taller than their genetic relatives, with the average male standing at 6’ 10”  and 250 pounds, while the average female sits at 6' 6” and 210 pounds. Despite this, perhaps their most important adaptations are their specialized sweat glands which produce a hydrophobic oil, along with their powerful frames necessary for supporting and supplying blood to their titanic heights.  

Due to Arenfürich being in a state of perpetual rainfall–save for the twice-annual "dry season" of snowfall–any sort of fur or hair which might retain water is a liability. Therefore, the Áren are hairless everywhere except for their scalp, which was retained for both sexual selection and spark shielding for the brain. But since protection against sparks is still necessary everywhere else, their skin is oddly smooth and slimy, with a rubbery white or black material—called rainward—covering rarely-stretched skin and utilizing the everstorm’s rainwater to produce a hydrophobic oil. It covers their hook-like strong feet as well, granting them a unique mobility on the water-slicked tree roots and swamp floors of Arenfürich.  

Like the other Halanian natives, their ears are made of hardened chitin and form part of a large horn structure, which varies in appearance between men and women. 

This is part of a larger trend of sexual dimorphism in the Áren. Rainward growths on Áren women focus more on the arms to leave the chest mostly bare, have a rounded shape, and are grayish in color. Growths on men are centered around the torso while still covering the arms, have jagged branching horns, and take on a dark black hue.

### Kaithurhi

A sub-species of the Áren highly adapted for life in the copperleaf forests, with extremely high defenses against disharmonic soulfire and an innate inability to use gimyndine. However, it is to be noted that they cannot produce significant amounts of soulfire on their own, and instead rely on resonant *Animarchaea* and ambient soulfire.   

To protect their soulfire-sensing organs, which are still necessary even in the high-soulfire environment of the copperleaf forest, they are encased within black knife-like upwards-facing horns with red sensing edges on the men, while on women they face downwards and curve like karambits, with blue sensing edges.  

They have lots of delphinidin and cyanidin hues, predominantly cyan, with tan skin. A light blue-purple shimmer is also present all over their skin and hair. Their hair skin-shimmer color is also heavily dependent on their diet, with the most important being the regular consumption of Sancffrwyth, a pure white berry with a pale cyan halo.  

There is also a notable mutation in the Kaithurhi, where the skin is turned white and acquired hair and eyes shades are pink and yellow. Kaithurhi possessing this trait are called Rosithurhi, and are revered as once-a-generation soul-mediums and leaders. They always possess red, exceptionally long, upwards horns.  

Of note is the Kaithurhi's distinct lack of spark sensors, due to all life in copperleaf forests simply using the already-material ambient soulfire. This also lends them to having incredible pyrrhoreceptors, however, since many more threats can harness soulfire.

### Muintaferan

A species closely related to the Kaithurhi, who live mostly on the bloodgrass plains just south of Kanthyna and the Hynawyll valley. They possess extremely dark skin, deer-like scarlet antlers, and almost homogeneously possess scarlet hair and eyes. Their ears are rounded and devoid of pyrrhoreceptors, something extremely rare in Aliffrüme and only shared with the Kaithurhi. Their hair and antlers help them to camouflage among the bloodgrass, resembling standing blades.  

Due to their grassland environment, they evolved rather long and powerful legs, which grants them a rather tall average height. In addition to their excellent stamina, this makes them well suited to long bouts of running. This lends itself to chasing down the agile prey on the plains, and makes a greater portion of their height compressible for hiding in the bloodgrass. Other species do believe it to look rather strange, however.  

They are known to most other races in the form of Cruín, Muintaferan who choose to dedicate their lives to assisting the good and kind. Although most are taught to respect the Cruín, some competitively-minded foreigners often capture the Muintaferan for sale into slavery. Not that the Jïumannians treat them much better, even if the populations outside the valley can flourish in modern gimyndized society.


## Llantakúna

As a species, the [[Glossary#^3687b2|Llantakúna]]'s main feature is their spark-utilizing undertone pigments, which can both dampen their presence by absorbing their sparks and help to passively regulate their temperature. Most usefully, the pigments can be genetically configured to either warm or cool by varying base amounts, as well as activated or deactivated spontaneously using acidity.

In practice, this means that the llantakúna are able to almost completely hide their aura at will, making them unnoticeable to wildlife and untrained sentients so long as they remain constant with the “background.” This does come at the cost of a temperature instability, loss of vision, and inability to breathe, but the effects can be managed and the skill trained.

The llantakúna also possess a number of minor traits to assist in this evolutionary strategy, including highly maneuverable fin-like ears and a sophisticated hearing system to match. This is due to the requirement of having shut, insulated eyes for the aura dulling to work (the eyes are a notorious shine-through point for sparks, given the lack of insulating bone between the brain and the outside world.)  

With regards to phenotypes, the llantakúna have a wide range of colors and defining physical characteristics across their species. Their hair and eye colors run the gamut, while the color of their undertone is colored largely depending upon the temperature of their climate. Colder climates result in a pale inactivated tone, neutral leads to vibrant colors, and warmer results in darker hues.

The hue of activated skin, however, is entirely unique to the individual, with some cultures even considering the privilege of seeing it–and the flamescript-like patterns from the individual inscribed in it–to be quite intimate, and thus often go hunting with only a full-body, easily-removable cloak for coverage. Oddly, this also means they think less of nudity when the skin is inactivated.

### Ayauitlaka

A race native to the mist-forests of Tohnipras, generally known for their large eyes, gray deactivated skin, iridescent activated skin, and small faces.  
One of their major adaptations is their continually-shifting grayish skin, mimicking the natural pattern noise of the Tohnipras mist. They are also able to consciously control it, but are limited to grayscale shades. The patterns function as a sort of emotional indicator as well, in a similar manner to flamescript. For this effect, many other species see an ethereal beauty in the patterns, while fellow members of the species use them as secondary identifiers. For this reason, covering too much skin is viewed as taboo, not dissimilar to the Hythean sentiment towards sunglasses and eyes.

### Yejian

The Yejian are a people adapted to life on the rocky shores of the Janta strait, with low spark tolerance–supplied naturally by the waters– and high soulfire sensitivity, for detecting threats underwater. Unlike the other races of the llantakúna, they universally possess a blue hue to their activated skin, and seldom ever deactivate it. Their hair is also often either sapphire, jet black, or anywhere in between.  

The Yejian are also capable of holding their breath for an extremely long time underwater, and possess a hearing system specially adapted for amphibious environments. They typically possess elongated arms, matched by a longer torso and a thin yet muscular body, all in service of a more able swimming form.

### Ninanyawi

Native to the tropical rainforests and wetlands of southern Tohnipras, the Ninanyawi are well-adapted to warm climates with their pitch-colored undertone and warm-colored camouflaging hair. Due to their rainforest habitat’s demands for hunting, they have the best hearing of any known race, including their fellow llantakúna.

### Nebvoltsi

An ancient race, named for their platinum blue hair, that inhabits the taigas and tundras of northern Tohnipras and Old Atleasia. They are the most soulfire sensitive race on Aliffrüme overall, possessing incredible sparksight and pyrrhoreceptors. Their excellent pyrrhoreceptors, like the schausen, were allowed by a lack of dense life to overload them.   

Their sparksight, meanwhile, is to assist in hunting. Given the extreme cold of the taigas, most life makes use of heat-generating firekeeping bacteria (including the Nebvoltsi themselves), meaning that animal life is forced to give off a distinct spark glow. The nebvoltsi mask this glow–and keep warm–with an overabundance of body hair in a peculiar cerulean color. This color is derived from a copper-based porphyrin, which is able to absorb sparks and safely generate heat to keep warm.

This pigment is so saturated in their bodies it even shows through their skin and sclera, as it makes their blood to be bluish purple.  

Similar to the Marmjogür, their skin and hair are pale, although tinged a platinum blue by their unique pigment. Unlike the Marmjogür, their sclera remain white, and they have a natural affinity for soulfire manipulation. Being able to conceal one’s sparks and efficiently generate heat on the tundras is an important evolutionary edge while rewarding firekeeping talent, and so many of the world’s elite [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] tend to be Nebvoltsi. Like many polar animals, they are also built large and strong to conserve heat, though the use of the copper uroporphyrin allows Nebvoltsi in particular to forgo the accruing of fat.



## Rokajun
A reclusive race that exclusively inhabits the island of Karaji, the [[Glossary#^d65fcd|Rokajun]]'s defining trait is their top-side soulfire sensitivity organs separate from their hearing ears, covered in fur-like hair to survive the Karaji winters. Like the Nebvoltsi, they also possess a copper pigment in their hair and skin, only one which has more of an emerald color. Their ears can vary in size and shape, resembling everything from fox to rabbit.  

Being a polar species, they are naturally built tall, strong, and hairy, while being paradoxically efficient. Long hair ranging from mint green to dark emerald covers the men and women, although not so thick as to cover the skin. Their feet are also known to be rather large and wide, an adaptation that assists in walking over snow.  

Because of the rare emerald color of their hair and fur, Rokajun are known to be captured into slavery and regularly shaved. The resultant fibers are sewn into black market jackets, rugs, or winter coats. Because of this fact, many roka in foreign nations hide their ears and hair.



## Tiangêngzhé
As a species, the main strength of the [[Glossary#^fe6428|Tiangêngzhé]] is their extreme compatibility with gimynfire and ghostbreathing. Their main adaptation is inbuilt pneumivorous pigments, allowing them to work long hours without food

Their pigments are exceptionally absorptive, and their bodies also seasonally purge and cycle them, which also happens to align with the pH cycle of many tropical climates.

### Eigrokonai

Also known as the Fallen, they are a species that fell with the solar-powered satellites around the equator, with their most notable adaptations being an albino, iridescent complexion, an exceptionally quick yet strong form, and an incredible stamina afforded by a hybrid metabolism with rhodopsin photosynthesis. Due to their ancestral heritage being in the natural gimyndine asteroid mines surrounding Aliffrume, they also possess sharp intuitive vision and sensitive EM vision, which affords them an easier time in spotting prey amidst the jungle.

### Altakhu

A prevalent race that inhabits Anndalor, with very high soulfire sensitivity, to the point where some altakhu have been known to become “ascendant,” surviving solely off of their own soulfire and never aging. Warm-skinned and warm-haired, they also possess enlarged pyrrhoreceptors in their ears, which grants them exceedingly long ears, even by Aliffrüme standards. These traits suggest a position among the technicians of the higher satellites, lithe frames and sensitive pyrrhoreception making them ideal circuit jockeys to patrol the underbelly.  

Notably, many altakhu possess a strange adaptation to their typical habitat of the Thundering Hills. Because of both the native grass and the Altakhu’s skin being highly insulative, a high amount of static electricity often builds up on their skin. This is amplified and further controlled by a unique soulfire organ, granting the Altakhu a natural control over electricity. Essentially, they have taser limbs.  

Finally, the altakhu have a notable physical distinction in their hair, caused by the cyclical acid-purging of their main grain. Hair grown during the acidic cycle will be more acidic-hued, and vice versa, leading to bands of color in whatever strands have grown long enough.

### Leaudoré

Thought to have served in the kitchens of the upper orbits, the Leaudoré have modified skin glands that produce a potent anesthetic and antibacterial oil, which the Hytheans were able to safely metabolize like capsaicin. This oil is particularly concentrated in 



## Zäkhisny
A mountain-born race hailing from the Riihian mountains, the [[Glossary#^a96094|Zäkhisny]] are known for their highly detailed spark vision and notable talent with artifice.
### Schausen
The Schausen (lit. “Black eyes”) are an ancient race that inhabit the Strahlerz Mountains in southern Riihiya. Their skin is pitch black, while also being rich in guanine, lending it an odd iridescent shimmer. This guanine layer reflects sparks away from the body, as opting for absorption in such a saturated environment would be catastrophic.  

In complete contrast, their hair is bleached white by the intense amounts of spark in their surroundings, leaving only rainbow-white guanine behind. One would think this counterproductive in a dark environment, but the chaotic and reflective nature of specially-structured guanine with spark actually creates a sort of scrambling effect, obscuring their form. Out of politeness, many Schausen tie up or cover their hair unless in the wild.  

The main survival adaptation of the schausen is their incredible intuitive senses, especially their intuitive hearing. With unique bat-like ears coated in guanine and capable of intricately folding, they can detect the exact directions of intuitive sounds and even hear the “voices” of gimyndine.  

Also due to the extreme amounts of spark found in the radiant caverns, they have lost the ability for conventional sight, and instead possess highly sensitive intuitive sight. Since it doesn’t have to share space with conventional color vision, the Schausen’s system is much more sensitive and precise enough to even function nearly identically to color vision. Due to the penetrating nature of sparks, their irises function in such a way that a gradated guanine pattern is pulled closer to the center for focusing, as opposed to manipulating a physical hole. Their sclera, meanwhile, are pitch black, to shield the inside of the eye.

### Marmjogür

The marmjogür (lit. “marble hunters”) are a species that inhabit the stellar plains in northern Riihiya, and bear resemblance to the schausen. They possess white, glimmering skin further supplemented in guanine by the consumption of a peculiar common grass on the stellar plains, glowleaf. Their hair, in contrast to the schausen, is naturally white, and contains an even higher amount of guanine. Their sclera remain black, here serving to sharpen their vision against the glare of the sun on the all-white plains.  

The marmjogür's most important adaptation is their ability to generate spontaneous heat on demand, useful for melting snow to harvest plants or hunt for subterranean prey. This is accomplished through a somewhat chemical process consisting of two parts. Firstly, marmjogür secrete a special kind of oil instead of sweat. When this oil is mixed with their saliva, it reacts and combines into a compound extremely dense with uroporphyrin rings that heat rapidly when exposed to sparks.

%% The average technological level of Aliffrüme as a whole is around the early industrial era; with cities, steamboats, complex navigation systems, and expensive, primitive firearms. However, large cities can be in possession of more advanced firekeeping devices, and nations such as Bergheim possess artifice advanced enough to put them in the late industrial period.  %%



### Blackfire Rifle

A relatively recent invention, and one of the most common tools of war and self-defense for flameless with the wealth to commission them, blackfire rifles utilize specialized charges packed with gimpowder and surrounded in a thin aluminum casing transparent to even blackfire. Upon use, the gimpowder is combusted and the blackfire is led along the “rifling” of the barrel, a simple flamescript for some effect along the lines of projectile launch or force delivery, sometimes aided by a targeting script.  

Due to the simplicity of the design and usage, blackfire rifles come in a wide variety of makes and qualities. Lower-quality versions are often manufactured by noble houses to equip their armed forces, but higher-quality versions are sometimes produced as gifts for flamescribes or people of high import.


## Blackfire Devices

A blackfire device is any instrument crafted with the use of low-grade [[Gimyndine#Ashstone|gimpowder]] in mind, with highly efficient [[Flamescript]] engraved into it. Due to the extremely low [[Soulfire#Gimynfire|gimynfire]] production of [[Gimyndine#Ashstone|blackstone]]–even when combusted–the flamescript which shapes the functions of these devices must be equally efficient, requiring a highly skilled [[Flamescribe|flamescribe]]. Due to this limitation, [[Firekeeping]] in the hands of the common folk is limited mostly to combustion, but many flamescribes and noble houses maintain similar items for convenience or war making, which are documented here.




### Gimtorch

A common method of lighting in wealthy manors, where a [[gimyndine|gimyn]] of little import is held in a cobalt chamber burned with a [[Flamescript|script]] for light production, resulting in a steady and warm pale-azure light. The blue color is merely tradition and preference, as any color can be produced with about the same difficulty, although white, composite, and impossible synesthetic colors prove much more difficult.


### Lightclock

One of the most common devices flamescribes produce for themselves, it a two-part lantern and timekeeping device. Constructed like an hourglass, [[Gimyndine#Ashstone|gimpowder]] gradually falls down into an ongoing [[Engram]] of a warm light and gets consumed. For [[Artifice|artificers]], this is often one of the first devices they make, as a good combination of physical mechanics and flamescript. These objects thus tend to have special import to their creators, and are decorated accordingly.


### Áren Monorail

A method of transport especially common in Arenfürich, involving a main carriage hanging from a suspended track underneath a canopy. This design keeps rain off of the tracks, though some rain is purposely diverted into the cars to satisfy Áren sensibilities. They are typically powered by gimpowder engines, but extravagant nobles may hire scriptlighters directly as a show of wealth.


### Crucibles

A crucible is a room-sized structure designed to completely enclose and amplify [[Gimyndine|gimynfire]] or [[Soulfire]], almost compressing it into a fluid in the air. Such an extreme environment allows for the construction of deep coupling bonds–also known as soulforging–as well as creating high-quality [[adamant]] by almost incarnating soulfire into powdered anthracite.


## Frames

A staple of the [[flamebearer]]’s professional sphere, a frame is any sufficiently large device intended to serve as an expansion of the bearer’s body, which allows for and facilitates high-level use of [[Soulfire#Gimynfire|gimynfire]]. Because most professional activities are locked behind that level of use, the ability to operate a frame is considered the mark of a fully-matured flamebearer.  
  
The principal purpose of a frame is twofold: a *capacitor* and a *reinforcement*. As a natural extension, they also serve to provide a great deal of protection to their users, while greatly enhancing their effective strength. There are myriad designs that meet these requirements, though they can generally be sorted into *two categories*.  

---
  
The most common category is commonly referred to as a “**sheath**” type, so named for their comparatively lean size and stature. Such frames are characterized by a focus on maintaining a high level of fluid gimynfire to be used in complex [[Engram|engrams]]. This is often accomplished by a characteristically small base frame, covered in flexibly crystalline “clothes” made of [[adamant]]. Though weak against pure kinetic weaponry, such frames excel at defending against infused attacks or engrams, and at dealing out such attacks themselves with their varied engrams. Due to their back-line tactics, focus on scriptcraft, and sheer sparkle factor, such frames are often popular with noble scions. 

---

The other category of frame is the “**titan**” class, characterized by a thick mass of steel armor and an equally imposing stature. As a counter to sheath frames, titan frames focus on kinetic force, using their large mass to wrangle enormous coupled weapons at blinding speeds. However, as most of their gimynfire is locked up and utilized in controlling the frame and its weapon, they often have little fire left for engrams, and as such are reliant on just their weapons. Though their mass does not belie their speed, as many titans are capable of just the same maneuvers as sheathes.  

---

Notably, a good number of frames do not fall perfectly into either category. Many sheathes will carry a kinetic weapon or wear heavier armor, while some titans might keep a surprise engram or two. The vast majority, in fact, use a blend of both styles.

### Framesouls

The heart of a frame, rather appropriately, is the framesoul. Defined as the part of a frame responsible for maintaining the support systems inherent in them, they include artificial [[Gimyndine]] pseudo-scribes, tamed wandersouls, and even a bonded flamescribe. Each method is more popular in certain spheres, as they each have their own benefits and drawbacks.  

The by far most common method is the pseudosoul, as both sufficiently competitive wandersouls and deep bonds with capable flamescribes are rare. Some of the more powerful gimyndine stones may even hold exotic engram elements like wandersouls, which is enough for many to look past the intense risks of glassrot, especially with improper use.  

On the other end, taming a wandersoul is regarded as a significant act, especially a more powerful one. Unlike pseudo-souls, wandersouls carry no risk of glassrot while offering comparable or greater power, which leads many to forget that the risk of lunacy is much higher if the soul is improperly tamed.  

The final, and most rare option, is using one's own flamescribe. On paper, it is the best option, as it carries no health risks, and scribes skilled in the practice far outcompete both other options. The main caveat is that it requires a deep bond with a highly skilled scribe, both rare things.  In addition, soulfire still needs to be sourced from somewhere, and the scribe needs to fit in the frame as well, which can lead to design complications.


## Highflame Instrument

Instruments belonging to the highflame class of firekeeping, i.e. that having to do with professional-grade [[Gimyndine]] or [[Soulfire]]. Such instruments are typically involved with the outfitting of [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]], but can also be found in industrial production or wealthy private-sector commissions.



### Skystilts

A common technology used by Halanian scriptlighters as a substitute for–and in many ways upgrade to–domesticated rideable animals or vehicles. Varying from little but wide metal bands harnessing the user to full suits granting the defense of an iron mountain, the uses of skystilts vary from mail carrying to martial domination. The most common design of skystilts is of a high-carbon alloyed metal melded with coalwire, fitted with various kindlegems for maneuverability and defense. Common examples include arrow-catchers, wind shields, brush-clearers, and drive assist.  
  
Lightweight skystilts, often called “spring legs,” are used by imperial couriers and war-lighters who prefer a speedier way of combat. They are characterized by wide metal bands running the length of the user as a harness, long spring-like stilts, and expandable gliding wings that also cut down brush and work as shields. Inbuilt kindlegems often focus on enhancing agility, endurance, and speed, making them suited to long-distance personal travel and fast-paced combat.  

Middleweight skystilts, called "iron legs," are characterized by metal plates mixed with brigandine and chainmail. A common accessory is a chain-whip for brush-clearing and grappling, or a chainmail cloak as a faraday cage. They are less suited to speedy maneuvers, but boast a much higher gimynfire tolerance and defense.  
  
Heavyweight skystilts, or "tree legs," are known for their imposingly wide figure, covered head to toe in interlocking plate. Virtually all the suit's mobility is put into counteracting the weight of the metal, leaving it grounded most of the time. But due to their large weight, they can take hold of much more massive coupled objects for use in siege or defense. Heavier models have even been known to lift house-sized boulders while using blazestones.


### Sliverwatches

Sliverwatches are devices common to see bound tightly to the wrists of high-ranking [[firekeeper]] generals, and are often used to specifically identify their rank as well. In terms of construction, a sliverwatch is rather simple: a thin wafer of gimyndine is held underneath a lead-glass panel (often engraved with a low-power script to keep time) and contained within a casing of a selected heavy metal, strapped to the wrist with a band often signifying rank, though the metal and ornate-ness of the casing can also accomplish this task.  

Sliverwatches are more than just convenient timekeeping devices, however, as they also catalyze an integral part of gimyndine firekeeping. In order to not lose a bond to a gimyn, a [[firekeeper]] must keep a portion of it close at all times, or else the connection will slowly fade. In addition, the lead-glass can also be lifted or otherwise opened, allowing access to the gimyn and the minimal fire it provides, for emergency uses.



### Kindlegems

Kindlegems are the most common way of storing/inscribing [[Engram|engrams]]. They are any structure made in such a way as to assist in storing and/or lighting [[Flamescript]]. They can vary wildly in shape, size, quality, and material; all depending on cost and purpose. There is a striking difference between common kindlegems made of heavy metal and [[adamant]]—intended to force [[Soulfire]] into a flamescript’s shape, and containing much simpler engrams for being unable to effectively fold—and [[flamebearer]]’s kindlegems made of various gemstones, though most commonly [[Flash Quartz|artificer’s quartz]] and diamond.

Common kindlegems, often referred to as smokeboxes, are containers designed to be used with machine-operated [[Firekeeping]]. Although the heavy metal is not conducive to folding of the script area, it allows gimynfire to be shaped without sapient intervention, and grants added toughness and durability for rougher situations. For these reasons, they are also given to flamebearers-in-training as practice devices. In such applications, they are colloquially referred to as kiddy-boxes.

Flamebearer’s kindlegems are typically gemstones or minerals with a highly-ordered crystal structure, composed primarily of the [[coupling elements]] like oxygen and silicon, with small heavy metal impurities. The coupling factor is balanced out, which allows for a nice middle ground between less re-scriptings and malleability. The orderly structure of the crystal also allows a much higher variance in engrams, due to the map of woven soulfire having more routine connections to make use of per unit volume. 


### Dreamleaf Juice

A product drawn from the leaves of dreamleaf plants in the mist-forests of southern [[Tohnipras]], known for its unique psychedelic effect of [[The Phlogistic Model#Immersionists|immersing]] users in the thoughts and dreams had by others near the plant before the time of harvesting. This property is believed to be derived from the slight [[Pneumaphilic Materials|pneumaphilic]] properties of Tohneasian mist, carrying residual [[Soulfire]] from the various creatures it contacts.  

Due to the especially unique quality of offering an exotic perspective, the juice is often vaporized and inhaled as a recreational drug by [[Llantakúna#Yejian|Yejian]] aristocrats, considered a high-class treat. The native [[Llantakúna#Ayauitlaka|Ayauitlaka]], however, consider the juice sacred as part of local tradition, used only during meditative rituals for the purposes of harmonizing with the forest. Using it for pleasure is considered blasphemous.


### Goldwood Paper

Also called goldsheet, goldwood paper is a special kind of paper made from the [[Plant Species#Goldwood|goldwood trees]] of the Kishian copperleaf forest, known for holding flamescript and soulfire for a ludicrous duration. The paper was often used in the past to make archives, books which held burnt [[Flamescript]] on their pages as a primitive method of portable engrams. Due to goldsheet's astounding longevity, however, many specimens of these archives persist to this day, and provide intriguing case studies in engram optimization, as the limited size of goldsheet forced ancient flamescribes to heavily optimize their engrams.


### Lazur
The gold-standard for scriptlighter's kindlegems, lazur is a mysterious melded alloy produced and sold exclusively by Bergheim and the Zäkhisny. Sold in various shapes, the alloy has an outer casing of aluminum and cobalt with an inner core of a strange nuclear-blue metal. The composition of the core has yet to be determined, and is a trade secret of the Bergian Alchemists.  

Kindlegems made of lazur are graded based on the purity of their crystal structure, in ranks from 0 (highest grade) to 11 (lowest grade), each rank representing a 1/12 increase in deformations per lattice. These ranks are often confused with engram orders, especially since engrams and kindlegems are so closely related.


### Melded Alloy
Often simply referred to as alloys, melded alloys are materials combined through [[Meldcraft|meldcraft]], often with a very meticulous and intentional structure, or between two materials which might otherwise be resistant to combination.

### Adamant
The common name for a [[Pneumaphilic Materials|pneumaphilic]] variety of man-made [[Soulforging|soulforged]] carbon allotropes, crafted into various crystal structures from various sources and with varying purities. The gold standard for the titular powder in [[Powderblade]] and [[Powderstaff|powderstaffs]], they are often separated into varying degrees of purity in regards to their crystal structure, as a higher grade enables denser gimynfire storage. They are also separated into color grades based on the type of and density of impurity.  

There are various kinds of adamant, depending upon the source of the carbon. The most common is made of bituminous coal, and which due to the various hydrogen and nitrogen impurities rather resembles ametrine: having a lilac and sunflower yellow color. The higher grades– which are made of anthracite–are initially colorless, but take on an emerald-green color as they are continually coupled due to spark irradiation. This is one of the major reasons for the association between hues of green and [[Firekeeping]] in many cultures.


### Flash Quartz

A variety of quartz used widely by [[Flamescribe|flamescribes]] and artificers as a sort of temporary medium for work-in-process [[Engram|engrams]]. It is artificially made by carefully melding pure sand into a near-perfect crystal structure, resulting in crystals which provide a low flashpoint and lower cost, if only presenting a passable permanence.  

Flash quartz is commonly used in the more common or disposable firekeeping tools, such as self-guiding arrows and labor tools, as well as in the implements of lower-ranked scriptlighters. Although, since most scriptlighters tend to be of a higher caste by law of supply and demand, this is rare.


## Pneumaphilic Materials
Contrasting [[pneumaphobic materials]], pneumaphilic materials are those which are generally receptive of soulfire, typically by a low flashpoint or general attractive quality.

### Silver-steel
A [[melded alloy]] used widely in scriptlighter’s armor and weapons, known for its high coupling factor and toughness while maintaining flexibility. Taking full advantage of the unique structures allowed by melding, silver-steel is composed of a tungsten-carbide outer shell, blacksteel inter-layer, and tungsten backing. The tungsten shell helps to deflect blades and projectiles while also contributing to a high reactive combustion capacity, while the blacksteel backing provides an elastic rebound for blunt weapons and easy self-repair through melding. The tungsten is also specially soulforged to have long, linear grains, helping to displace energy. When breaking, the outer shell expanding under the swell of the blacksteel also helps to soften the impact.



### Torhith

A mineral exclusively found in the steamrise caves of [[Halisan#Arenfürich|Arenfürich]], famed far and wide for the vibrant colors of light that seem trapped within. Cynics sometimes refer to the stone as “fool’s [[Gimyndine]],” as good cuts can resemble high-quality gimyns, but those capable of resonating can tell at a glance that torhith lacks the resonating properties which makes gimyndine so useful.


### Oversense

Officially scribed in 1009 AL, the titular extrasensory [[Engram|engram]] Oversense was first created by the eponymous [[Reinlutre|Artery Jöendjëwitt]] to serve as a simple lifestyle improvement after the loss of her vision. The original version functioned by producing a small [[Soulfire|soulfire]] wind from [[Soul|Soul]], allowing the environment to be “felt” through proprioception. Without active management, this method resembles EM sight in that perspective remains important, although perception is simultaneously omnidirectional. It also requires a fair amount of power, and is hard to maintain while utilizing other engrams.  

Further improvements on the engram instead pivoted towards embedding the [[Soul|halo]] within [[Conscious Plane|the conscious plane]] to feel its curvature, creating what amounts to an extracorporeal sense of touch within a certain radius. As it still operates within the intuitive, this sense can only detect [[Infusion|infused matter]] or soulfire, though because the halo is still expanded in this version a light infusion still falls on the nearby available matter, making this a moot point.  

However, this method proves difficult for persons used to 2D vision to visualize, and so further advancements on the technique instead wire the halo similar to hearing, at the expense of significant information loss. Thus many start with this model to ease themselves into proficiency with the former.  

The development of oversense depended heavily on the simultaneous development of [[Dynamic Space Theory]], in order to feel infusion by curvature rather than force. This provided the necessary jump in efficiency to allow the engram to be used while maneuvering without significant training or inhibition. Thus in modern times, many [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] now familiarize themselves with foundational oversense as part of their training, as the proper extension of the natural senses.


### Storm’s Harmony

One of the more ornamental [[Engram|engrams]], it was designed by [[Consciousness#Kuthjïuman|Áren]] flamescribe [[Ashjërunei Riemend]] as a gift for [[Reinlutre]] during the Welatorhith Kindling Ceremony of 1008 AL. The engram’s function is to conjure a rainharp by catching rain from around the lighter, freezing the strings into glass-like ice. The rainharp can then be played like any other of its kind, and it produces a deep aquatic tone unique to the instrument, but this is not the engram’s main feature.   

Upon the direction of the lighter, rain can be slowed and captured into an acoustic array of floating water orbs glowing with [[Soulfire]], producing sound by vibrating the heavy minerals in the rain. The orbs can also be united into concentric rings of softly illuminating singing water, a tool only useful in the hands of an expert.  

The engram takes inspiration from other rainharp engrams–which were a common gift to musician spouses–but employs complicated techniques and almost seems to contain engrams within engrams as a customary display of skill for the [[Traditions#Bond Festival|Kindling Ceremony]].  

The engram’s true beauty, however, lies in the efficiency of the [[Flamescript]]. To accomplish its effects with traditional scribing techniques would require a prohibitive amount of [[Soulfire|gimynfire]] only handleable by a [[Organizations#**Scriptlighter Ranks**|highkeeper]], but the engram is accessible with as little as a [[Gimyndine|palestone]]. This enables a performance to last as long as the musician can think of music, appealing directly to extended soloists and symphonies, something previously unheard of for orchestras incorporating instruments operating with firekeeping.


### Enjärl BW-14

The standard-issue main weapon of Saorann infantry. Its shape resembles a white metal longrifle, with a spherical cavity just above the handle for the large kindlegem. Specially designed to kill by creating an intense gravity field around a launched projectile, with each bullet containing ignition gimpowder, a miniaturized kindlegem, and the lead projectile.


### Powderblade

One of the more commonplace weapons for infantry-hunting scriptlighters, they are a wide class of devices that operate on the fundamental principle of constructing a monocrystal diamond blade out of powerdized carbon. The resulting blade channels gimynfire exceedingly well, almost serving to become a blade of pure gimynfire. In addition to carbon’s exceptional responsiveness to gimynfire control, coupling allows the diamond’s covalent bonds to loosen and gain elasticity, making it more suitable for a blade.  

All of the above factors serve to make the blade roughly equivalent to a traditional silver-steel blade, but this is not the true purpose of powderblades. Instead, they serve as a countermeasure to heavyweight scriptlighters and their high-flashpoint armor. When coupled armor is struck with a powderblade, there is naturally a combustion event, resulting in the decoupling of the blade and the draining of the armor’s coupling charge. However, the pure-crystal carbon structure of the powderblade is easily re-coupled and reformed, whereas the high-resistance armor would require full focus to recharge. The shattering blade also means that an attack can be fully followed through, maintaining the attacker’s speed. In this way, the heavyweight can be steadily worn down for a chance at victory.  

The main design of a powderblade is, appropriately, in the handle, which looks much too long for the short, knife-like blade stem. The two marks of a well-crafted powderblade are the efficiency of the core kindlegem, and the crystal purity of the diamond dust. The more efficient the kindlegem is, the more gimynfire can be run through the blade; the purer the crystals, the easier they can be recoupled.  

Powderblades may come in numerous forms, each depending on the efficiency of their creator. Some of the well designed versions are more like swarms of scintillating darts when fighting infantry, but can coalesce into a blade for close-quarters combat; this melee configuration being necessary for scriptlighter conflict as dart weapons could be easily challenged and counter-coupled.  

Powderblades are no slouch when it comes to other areas of use as well. Since the diamond blade is able to exude a highly dense gimynfire cloud just around the blade, it's possible to learn to use this cloud to temporarily couple and rend any material the blade strikes, making it like a traditional sword. The technique requires extreme concentration and timing at first, but becomes second nature with practice or well-made kindlegems.



### Powderstaff

A common implement for support-focused or civilian [[Flamebearer|flamebearers]], and a catch-all term for any device which constructs a [[Adamant|monocrystal]] tool. In this case, monocrystal’s use lies within its reusability and relatively high [[Soulfire|soulfire]] capacity. Some [[Engram|engrams]] require intense bursts of gimynfire, but uncoupled gimynfire disperses quickly, and the human body will succumb to [[glassrot]] rapidly if [[Coupling|coupling]] is attempted. As a solution, many tools form monocrystals as a form of quick-discharge capacitor, often resembling staffs or floating orbs.



### Rodgun

An experimental Raincatcher technology which uses multiple instances of [[Adamant|monocrystals]] which protrude from a main body like vacuum tubes or rods, in order to facilitate sequenced blasts. The main problem with this technology is controlling the resonant combustion, as detonating a crystal of course causes a combustion event, which easily causes other nearby monocrystals to detonate. This would necessitate the storing of rods somewhere too far away to be convenient for multiple shots, which is the advantage of rod guns in the first place.  

One proposed countermeasure is heavy blue-lead shielding around an ammo satchel, but this would limit the speed of continuous fire and put a heavy weight burden on a soldier. This method is nonetheless common for high-power rodguns, where the shielding can double as spark protection, and the large size of the bag is already necessary.  

Another method is to shape the combustion instead of stopping it, using it to easily detonate the next rod for automatic fire. The problem here is in making an efficient loop, as the process is like trying to catch a baseball that one just threw.


### Slug-catchers

An extremely common supplemental [[kindlegem]] to a lightweight flamebearer's [[silver-steel]] half-plate and [[Adamant|shimmercloth]]. Typically embedded somewhere safe, a slug-catcher system serves to detect incoming projectiles, throw up a localized net of gimynfire to “catch” the projectile and somehow deal with it. The most common design is to subtly alter the projectile’s path so as to not hit the target, but others may put in the energy to fully redirect the projectile or capture it.

Notably, this method breaks down in the extreme case that the projectile is extremely fast. However, this also means that the projectile is likely very small, and also has a very predictable trajectory. In this case, a slug-catcher will often not "catch" the projectile at all, and will instead selectively harden the impact area.

Each slug-catcher system is unique, especially depending upon how much [[Soulfire|soulfire]] can be devoted to it. A common middle ground is a detection range of around 10 meters, and a maximum projectile mass of 10 kilograms, the average weight of a cannonball.



### SR87

The standard-issue [[Flamebearer|flamebearer]]'s scepter of Saorann, which is also able to transform into a sniper rifle through the use of a simple [[Engram]]. Can house up to 20 [[Kindlegem|kindlegems]], most often long-range support ones. Common engrams include reflective shields, [[gimyndine]] resonator bombs, aerial bombardment, and trap fields.
