# Gimtorch

A common method of lighting in wealthy manors, where a [[gimyndine|gimyn]] of little import is held in a cobalt chamber burned with a [[Flamescript|script]] for light production, resulting in a steady and warm pale-azure light. The blue color is merely tradition and preference, as any color can be produced with about the same difficulty, although white, composite, and impossible synesthetic colors prove much more difficult.
