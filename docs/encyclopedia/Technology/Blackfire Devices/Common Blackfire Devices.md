## Blackfire Devices

A blackfire device is any instrument crafted with the use of low-grade [[Gimyndine#Ashstone|gimpowder]] in mind, with highly efficient [[Flamescript]] engraved into it. Due to the extremely low [[Soulfire#Gimynfire|gimynfire]] production of [[Gimyndine#Ashstone|blackstone]]–even when combusted–the flamescript which shapes the functions of these devices must be equally efficient, requiring a highly skilled [[Flamescribe|flamescribe]]. Due to this limitation, [[Firekeeping]] in the hands of the common folk is limited mostly to combustion, but many flamescribes and noble houses maintain similar items for convenience or war making, which are documented here.
