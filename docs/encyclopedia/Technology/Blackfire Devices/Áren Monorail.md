# Áren Monorail

A method of transport especially common in Arenfürich, involving a main carriage hanging from a suspended track underneath a canopy. This design keeps rain off of the tracks, though some rain is purposely diverted into the cars to satisfy Áren sensibilities. They are typically powered by gimpowder engines, but extravagant nobles may hire scriptlighters directly as a show of wealth.
