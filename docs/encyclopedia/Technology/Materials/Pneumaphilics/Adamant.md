# Adamant
The common name for a [[Pneumaphilic Materials|pneumaphilic]] variety of man-made [[Soulforging|soulforged]] carbon allotropes, crafted into various crystal structures from various sources and with varying purities. The gold standard for the titular powder in [[Powderblade]] and [[Powderstaff|powderstaffs]], they are often separated into varying degrees of purity in regards to their crystal structure, as a higher grade enables denser gimynfire storage. They are also separated into color grades based on the type of and density of impurity.  

There are various kinds of adamant, depending upon the source of the carbon. The most common is made of bituminous coal, and which due to the various hydrogen and nitrogen impurities rather resembles ametrine: having a lilac and sunflower yellow color. The higher grades– which are made of anthracite–are initially colorless, but take on an emerald-green color as they are continually coupled due to spark irradiation. This is one of the major reasons for the association between hues of green and [[Firekeeping]] in many cultures.
