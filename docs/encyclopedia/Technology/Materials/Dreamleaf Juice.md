# Dreamleaf Juice

A product drawn from the leaves of dreamleaf plants in the mist-forests of southern [[Tohnipras]], known for its unique psychedelic effect of [[The Phlogistic Model#Immersionists|immersing]] users in the thoughts and dreams had by others near the plant before the time of harvesting. This property is believed to be derived from the slight [[Pneumaphilic Materials|pneumaphilic]] properties of Tohneasian mist, carrying residual [[Soulfire]] from the various creatures it contacts.  

Due to the especially unique quality of offering an exotic perspective, the juice is often vaporized and inhaled as a recreational drug by [[Llantakúna#Yejian|Yejian]] aristocrats, considered a high-class treat. The native [[Llantakúna#Ayauitlaka|Ayauitlaka]], however, consider the juice sacred as part of local tradition, used only during meditative rituals for the purposes of harmonizing with the forest. Using it for pleasure is considered blasphemous.
