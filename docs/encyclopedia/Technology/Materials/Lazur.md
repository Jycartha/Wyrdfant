# Lazur
The gold-standard for scriptlighter's kindlegems, lazur is a mysterious melded alloy produced and sold exclusively by Bergheim and the ZÃ¤khisny. Sold in various shapes, the alloy has an outer casing of aluminum and cobalt with an inner core of a strange nuclear-blue metal. The composition of the core has yet to be determined, and is a trade secret of the Bergian Alchemists.  

Kindlegems made of lazur are graded based on the purity of their crystal structure, in ranks from 0 (highest grade) to 11 (lowest grade), each rank representing a 1/12 increase in deformations per lattice. These ranks are often confused with engram orders, especially since engrams and kindlegems are so closely related.
