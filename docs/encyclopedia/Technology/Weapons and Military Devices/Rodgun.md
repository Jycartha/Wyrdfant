# Rodgun

An experimental Raincatcher technology which uses multiple instances of [[Adamant|monocrystals]] which protrude from a main body like vacuum tubes or rods, in order to facilitate sequenced blasts. The main problem with this technology is controlling the resonant combustion, as detonating a crystal of course causes a combustion event, which easily causes other nearby monocrystals to detonate. This would necessitate the storing of rods somewhere too far away to be convenient for multiple shots, which is the advantage of rod guns in the first place.  

One proposed countermeasure is heavy blue-lead shielding around an ammo satchel, but this would limit the speed of continuous fire and put a heavy weight burden on a soldier. This method is nonetheless common for high-power rodguns, where the shielding can double as spark protection, and the large size of the bag is already necessary.  

Another method is to shape the combustion instead of stopping it, using it to easily detonate the next rod for automatic fire. The problem here is in making an efficient loop, as the process is like trying to catch a baseball that one just threw.
