### Powderstaff

A common implement for support-focused or civilian [[Flamebearer|flamebearers]], and a catch-all term for any device which constructs a [[Adamant|monocrystal]] tool. In this case, monocrystalâ€™s use lies within its reusability and relatively high [[Soulfire|soulfire]] capacity. Some [[Engram|engrams]] require intense bursts of gimynfire, but uncoupled gimynfire disperses quickly, and the human body will succumb to [[glassrot]] rapidly if [[Coupling|coupling]] is attempted. As a solution, many tools form monocrystals as a form of quick-discharge capacitor, often resembling staffs or floating orbs.
