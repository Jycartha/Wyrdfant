# Infusion

Perhaps the most basic interaction, [[Soulfire]] undergoes infusion when itâ€™s radially compressed by [[Conscious Plane|the Conscious Plane]], shunting it down into the physical realm. This process also generates a form of radiation called [[Soulfire#Sparks|sparks]], in order to preserve the information lost in converting continuous soulfire to quantized reality. Only infused soulfire is capable of directly interacting with matter or the physical forces.
