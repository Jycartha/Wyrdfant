# Coupling

Coupling is a phenomenon wherein [[Spin Friction|spun]], [[Infusion|infused]] [[Soulfire]] augments the structure of a material, significantly raising its structural integrity and causing it to become a natural attractor of soulfire, as well as allowing direct control of the matter through conscious force, while preserving conservation of momentum by imparting equal and opposite momentum on the coupler. Traditionally organic matter– such as carbon, oxygen, and other light elements–is easier to impart soulfire into, although it takes a much lower concentration to [[gimyndization|gimyndize]] it. On the other end, heavy metals have much higher coupling breakpoints, but can hold a coupling for much longer.

Coupling is gradually worn down over time with spin decay, and needs to be spun anew to maintain the same responsiveness and upper limit to force. Due to the workings of coupling, the bodies of nearly every living being are naturally coupled to some degree. Since molecular bonds are enhanced by coupling, this grants a natural durability to those high in soulfire, and even allows them to manipulate more force through their body with delicate soulfire control. Taking gimynfire into the body like this is possible, but it induces rapid [[gimyndization]] and gradually increasing pain.

In modern firekeeping, coupling is the main method by which martial flamebearers achieve their effects, with more complex effects generally not worth the cost from abstraction drag, or the time investment to remove said drag. In this regard, the main action of martial scriptlighting is the coupling and manipulation of nearby matter, supplemented with automated routines or reactions inscribed into kindlegems as flamescript.

An important mechanic of coupling lies in its forceful removal, called a challenge. According to the Rule of Proximity–which states that control of soulfire gets inverse squarely more difficult as the distance from the source increases–when a rival scriptlighter is closer to a coupled object than the original coupler, they can challenge the coupling by attempting to forcefully infuse their own soulfire and override the existing coupling. If successful, they capture the coupled object for their own manipulation. Materials with a higher coupling breakpoint are naturally more difficult to challenge, and certain objects are even impossible to couple unless some condition is dealt with.

Notably, coupled objects are indistinguishable from others, except by the way they reflect sparks like an iridescent shimmer. This is used to great effect in various martial disciplines, throwing fake knives to hide the coupled one from a challenge. The dominant color of the shimmer depends upon the color of the soulfire possessing it, and the saturation on the amount.
