# Meldcraft

A discipline which takes advantage of coupling’s ability to mix and shuffle molecular bonds for alloying, engineering, and artistic purposes. It is especially common in cultures where scriptlighters are viewed less as tools of war and more tools of convenience, mostly focused in Tohnipras and Riihya.

More than any other school of firekeeping, meldcraft relies heavily on [[Kindlegem]] improved over many generations and kept as close family secrets, due to the incredibly precise nature of molecular structure. A common way the problem is simplified is with the granular model, which simplifies materials into discrete granules to be managed. With this method, the mark of skill is the “resolution” of a work, or how small the granules can be made.

In engineering, meldcraft is often used to make extremely strong bonds and materials not normally possible. One material commonly used in place of steel for high-demand applications is silver-steel, a melded alloy which combines extreme-hardness linear-grain tungsten with a backplate of pliable blacksteel.
