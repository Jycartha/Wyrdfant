### Hagnomy

The study of [[Soulfire]] and [[Conscious Plane]], and how soulfire interacts with itself. It involves the study of [[Engram#Abstraction Drag|abstraction drag]], [[infusion]] techniques, [[Phlogistic Computing]], resonance, [[Soulfire#gimynfire|gimynfire]] control, and other fields. Essentially, hagnomy is to firekeeping like physics is to engineering. 

Hagnomists are often looked down on as people who canâ€™t focus on reality, but other [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] appreciate their curiosity for the abstract.
