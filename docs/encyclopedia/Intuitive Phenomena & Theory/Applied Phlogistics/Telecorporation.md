# Telecorporation

The process of using phlogistics to achieve an effect like teleportation, by converting the body into a dense shell of fire around the soul and accelerating it with an Alcubierre-like intention field. This removes the acceleration limit placed by infusion slipping, but requires extreme skill with corporeal/intuitive manipulation and self-determination.

It is also possible to transport non-organic mass this way, but it suffers such a large conversion penalty as to be impractical for anything beyond personal equipment. Similarly, it's even more difficult to transport persons other than oneself in this manner. However, some Hythean-era relics are known to encode highly efficient algorithms that make this feasible, given a designated fixed point.
