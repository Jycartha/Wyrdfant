### Central Calendar

The universally employed calendar system of Aliffrüme, and a relic from the Hythean Era. It contains 660 days split into a sequential summer and winter semicycle, each with 9 months of 36 days and one intercalary week; all split into weeks of 6 days. A full cycle of the calendar is called a twïchircul, in Halanian. Every 20 cycles, a leap month consisting of 13 days is added to account for drift. The months, in Halanian, are as follows:

1. Forma (Form-)  
2. Öðer (Öte-)  
3. Thridda (Thri-)  
4. Feorþa (Feor-)  
5. Fifta (Fit-)  
6. Siexta (Siex-)  
7. Seofoþa (Seof-)  
8. Eiatoþa (Eia-)  
9. Nijöþa (Nijö-)

During the summer semicycle, Sol- is prefixed to the month's name, while during the winter, Mone- is appended.

The days of the week–in Halanian–are, in order:

1. Golatüimdajë  
2. Sielledajë  
3. Akafreydajë  
4. Arbladajë  
5. Gyllicadajë  
6. Fürehterdajë

Most commonly, the last 2 days of the week are considered days of rest, or in Halanian cultures specifically assigned to personal study. Under the following system, a complete statement of the day would be “Solötethriddes Arbladajë,” Arblad’s day of the third week of the second month of the first semester. A legal adult in most nations is 24 semicycles old, though a good number lower it to 18.
