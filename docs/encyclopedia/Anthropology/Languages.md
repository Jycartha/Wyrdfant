## Ayangatalan

### Naming Conventions

Given that Ayangatal-derived cultures are typically highly individualistic, those born into them are typically referred to by nicknames as children, with official documents using their parent’s name (of the same sex, if applicable) and an ordinal. For example, the first son of Altan, his father, would be called Altanyn Ekhleed (First of Altan). After their 12th cycle, a child is expected to choose their own given name, and referring to them by their patronymic from then on is considered rude.

### Naming Conventions

  The countries of [[Halisan]] are notably unanimous in their naming standards, with the exceptions being Mingxiao and the Ametsuji. Like most Thassalian cultures, the first name is granted by the parents, a middle name is taken from the mother, and the last name is taken from the father. A typical full name for a [[Jïumannes|Jïumannian]] woman would be Baswa Feiritha Bloedmyn.

## Elhwyn

  The traditional language of the Eldwyth Tribes, of a highly polysynthetic and Welsh-like character.

### Naming Conventions

Members of the tribes are granted only one name at birth, typically after one of the features of nature that can be seen nearby. This name is called the “core name,” and using it by itself to address a Kaithurhi is something incredibly intimate, and reserved only for married couples and a mother addressing her daughter. On the flip side, using only a demonym or title is considered extremely impersonal, and rude in friendly contexts.  
Before the core name is almost always a pre-name, or title, with various phonemes arranged in order to:

* 1\. Establish rank/title  
* 2\. Establish job
* 3\. Establish marital status  

A Kaithuhri’s full name (all possible prefixes and suffixes) is only ever used on legal documents, or when formally introducing oneself. Marital status is only included in casual situations where romance is involved.
