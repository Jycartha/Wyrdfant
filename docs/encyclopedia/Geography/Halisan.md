# **Halisan**

### Hynawyll Valley

The home of the largest copperleaf forest in Halisan, Kanthyna, through which runs the exceedingly large Symywldwyth River. The river’s name, meaning “river of shifting color” in the native Eldwyn language, comes from the abundance of fotivorous algae genus *Animarchaea*. This river runs for more than a thousand miles throughout the forest, carrying pure soulfire to all the fotivorous plants and shimmer-beasts.

### Tereghda

An area just south of the Hynawyll Valley, called Dayadach (lit. “Scarlet Homeland,”) is the ethnic home of the Muintaferan and is known for it’s bloodgrass grasslands.   
The ecosystem is monopolized by a species of an extremely tall scarlet-colored fotivorous grass, which harvests soulfire with its roots from gimyndine brought close to the surface.

### Fahbrim Sea

A massive freshwater lake at the center of Halisan, which makes it look more like an atoll. The sea itself is fairly shallow, being 76 feet deep on average, and many adapt to life above and below the surface. The lake is mildly radiative, on account of some gimyndine runoff from the western mountains, and so many of the Halisan poor will irradiate themselves fishing for a good giymn to sell.

### Arenfürich

Arenfürich (lit. “Forest of Eternal Rain”) is one of the largest rainforests on Aliffrüme, and an extremely peculiar ecosystem. The forest is kept in a perpetual cycle of rainfall by Räl, Lord of the Everstorm, a powerful ambivalent wandersoul. The strength of the rain varies, but it invariably falls, and falls into deep pools called torhith pits where it’s vaporized into towering updrafts called steamclimbs, returning to the sky to fall again. Carried with the steam is reused minerals converted from the waste matter washed down into the pits by specialized bacteria, which then rains down back onto the forest to nurture further life.  
The incredible erosion of this climate, though tempered by the rain carrying minerals, highly favors large trees with deep and thick roots. These root systems form the de facto ground floor of the rainforest, carving deep canyons and caverns that the native Áren traverse with great expertise. Specific far-reaching roots are often marked with bioluminescent paint, and traversed by way of specialized firekeeping techniques (root-skaters) or carved-out waterways.  

One of the largest cities in Arenfürich–a mining town named Welatorhith–is actually situated around the Great Torhith Pit, the ultimate watershed of the Arenfürich basin. The pit is large enough to have multiple intakes, and even some infrastructure built down into it, constructed to withstand the intense heat from the steam.
