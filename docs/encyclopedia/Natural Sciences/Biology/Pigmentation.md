# Pigmentation

There are two main methods of protecting against sparks: Reflection by a lattice of guanine and collagen, or absorption by anthocyanins.

* **Guanine** \- Present in spark sensing organs, the hair and fur of many fauna, and [[Consciousness#Schausen|Schausen]] skin. Can be many colors, but most often is a glittering white.

* **Anthocyanins** \- Present as hair pigmentation in many lifeforms, often as some shade of purple for better camouflage among the leaves of bacteriorhodopsin-dyed purple plants. Also serves to protect the brain from pixies, psychedelic hallucinations caused by sparks that can cause long-term mental damage.

  * **NOTE** \- Astaxanthin is proven to be a lipid-soluble pigment, can be blue and red to make purple. Anthocyanin is preferable because it is single-compound and easily available, but not proven uptakeable.

* **Photosynthetic** \- Bacteriorhodopsin (a purple photosynthetic) is the main photosynthesis system on
