A most-often acquired, though also congenital, condition which entails a total inability to form [[Engram|engrams]], [[Flamescript|flamescript]], or any other kind of mental picture. For unknown reasons, this grants the afflicted an almost superhuman resistance to the various disadvantages of [[Gimyndine|gimyndine]]. Most notably, aphantasiacs will no longer go mad from extended gimyndine resonance, nor suffer identity death or gimyndization.  

Aphantasia is often acquired by uncautious scriptlighters as a result of over-reliance on kindlegems, and they are subsequently rendered unable to use anything but. Almost as a trade-off, however, aphantasiacs gain the ability to effortlessly draw out and shape gimynfire in enormous quantities, if with limited precision.   

For this reason, some may even seek out aphantasia to chase simple, raw, overwhelming power with coupling. A number of militaries and terrorist organizations have experimented with inducing aphantasia after a subject has suffered identity death, resulting in a mindless soldier with an impenetrable gimynfire barrier and titanic coupling strength. The practice is naturally considered extremely immoral and cruel, and is considered an abominable war crime by many peoples and nations.
