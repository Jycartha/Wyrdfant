# Rokajun
A reclusive race that exclusively inhabits the island of Karaji, the [[Glossary#^d65fcd|Rokajun]]'s defining trait is their top-side soulfire sensitivity organs separate from their hearing ears, covered in fur-like hair to survive the Karaji winters. Like the Nebvoltsi, they also possess a copper pigment in their hair and skin, only one which has more of an emerald color. Their ears can vary in size and shape, resembling everything from fox to rabbit.  

Being a polar species, they are naturally built tall, strong, and hairy, while being paradoxically efficient. Long hair ranging from mint green to dark emerald covers the men and women, although not so thick as to cover the skin. Their feet are also known to be rather large and wide, an adaptation that assists in walking over snow.  

Because of the rare emerald color of their hair and fur, Rokajun are known to be captured into slavery and regularly shaved. The resultant fibers are sewn into black market jackets, rugs, or winter coats. Because of this fact, many roka in foreign nations hide their ears and hair.
