### Blackfire Rifle

A relatively recent invention, and one of the most common tools of war and self-defense for flameless with the wealth to commission them, blackfire rifles utilize specialized charges packed with gimpowder and surrounded in a thin aluminum casing transparent to even blackfire. Upon use, the gimpowder is combusted and the blackfire is led along the “rifling” of the barrel, a simple flamescript for some effect along the lines of projectile launch or force delivery, sometimes aided by a targeting script.  

Due to the simplicity of the design and usage, blackfire rifles come in a wide variety of makes and qualities. Lower-quality versions are often manufactured by noble houses to equip their armed forces, but higher-quality versions are sometimes produced as gifts for flamescribes or people of high import.
