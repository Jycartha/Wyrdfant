# Firekeeping

Applied [[phlogistics]] for various purposes, including engineering, medicine, and many other fields.

## Usage

All firekeeping begins with the generation of [[Soulfire]], which is then manipulated in some manner to achieve some effect. It can be suddenly compressed to exert an explosive pressure, run over [[flamescript]] to affect [[Engram|engrams]], or used for its [[The Phlogistic Model#Fluidic Pressure|fluid mechanics]], in increasing order of complexity.

All life can control ambient [[soulfire]] and even produce its own, but sourcing it from [[gimyndine]] is much more potent and allows easier use when integrated with [[Kindlegem]]. This led to [[gimyndine]] technology and its derivatives becoming the forefront of development for centuries, and many self-sourced firekeeping techniques became relegated to folk contexts or small communities, where the usage of [[gimyndine]] was either impractical from extenuating circumstance, or rejected on principle.
