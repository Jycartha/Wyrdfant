### Artifice

The study of combining [[flamescript]] with machinery, giving rise to contraptions capable of [[firekeeping]]. The field is further broken down into fields normally associated with purely physical engineering: Aerial artifice, mechanical artifice, etc. The distinction is practical as not all environments are as conducive to [[gimyndine]] as others, and some applications simply donâ€™t merit the complexity of phlogistic techniques.
