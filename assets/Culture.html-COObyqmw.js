A guild of [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]], the Order is divided into wraithtamers (gimynkeepers) and carvers (flamescribes). For the purposes of appeasing the lingering cultural distrust of gimyndine-wielding “demon hosts,” the carvers are assigned the duty of regulating the truly complex engrams and managing captured gimyns outside of combat. Wraithtamers, meanwhile, are allowed to exude dominance and glory in various styles of martial combat.</p><p>To provide a brief history, as scriptlighters—now preferring to call themselves stone-tamers, who hunted and bound the “demonic stones” to prevent them from falling into the hands of evildoers and force their power to be used for good—inevitably came to prominence once again, the power structure of Anndalor once again came to resemble a pyramid of firekeeping ability.</p><p>This time around, however, the stone-tamers were careful to keep themselves “bound” by religious law and purpose. Advances in gimyndine research brought about the profession of flamescribes, or “carvers” as it were. With the ability to conveniently lock the “truly dangerous” engrams of automatic shields and hails of knives behind the skills of another, a new order soon emerged.</p><p>Carvers were granted the holy duty of deeming how much force was appropriate for a stone-tamer to exert, and of handling administration affairs of normal religion. Meanwhile, their hands were kept clean of the actual devastation, securing the status quo against unhealable revolt. Behind closed doors, the two factions often split into smaller groups and struggled for local power, becoming the true cause behind many border squabbles.</p><p>Under the order and the expectations of Ayangatalan culture, carvers are almost unilaterally women for their management duties and position out of the fight. Similarly, wraithtamers are expected to be men–or at least masculine–for their duties of combat, defense, and valor.</p><h2 id="jiumannes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#jiumannes"><span>Jïumannes</span></a></h2><h3 id="stormrunners" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stormrunners"><span>Stormrunners</span></a></h3><p>A major component of Aren culture, equivalent to mythological heroes. Against the stoneghost anti-firekeeping doctrine, they were notable for using firekeeping to maneuver the storms without relying on infrastructure, expelling the colonizers and making firekeeping a symbol of national pride.<br> Though historically the Stormrunners were luciants, time has changed them to also be thought of as gimyndine wielders, subsequently legitimizing the practice.</p><h3 id="flamescribe-etiquette" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#flamescribe-etiquette"><span>Flamescribe Etiquette</span></a></h3><p>When dealing with a prestigious position like that of the flamescribe, it is only natural that some degree of special social rules and faux pas would come to surround them. The attitudes vary between the native states and the royal states, but they are largely a sort of upper class even within the nobility, equal to and sometimes synonymous with priests, depending on the local religion’s attitudes.</p><p>A special exception in Jïumannian social etiquette for flamescribes is in regards to the viewing of another’s flamescript. Flamescribes are the only social caste allowed to view the bare flamescript of another in full emotionality, for the purposes of research and collective knowledge. This is especially important given that flamescript deteriorates rapidly over time on the scale of records, and text descriptions of various methods are rarely sufficient.</p><h3 id="beorgrad-system" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#beorgrad-system"><span>Beorgrad System</span></a></h3><p>A unique method of distinguishing approximate social classes within Jïumannian firekeeping circles, based upon the color and prominence of metallic flecks in one’s eyes. The origins of the system are relatively simple, as the flecks tend to scatter sparks.<br> The highest class is gulwen, assigned to rulers and high nobility with shining golden flecks in their irises. Golden flecks are always found in royal eyes, while also appearing in noble eyes with less frequency.<br> The next highest class is selnir, reserved for lower nobility and renowned commoners with silver flecks in their irises. If there are no golden flecks in the noble eye colors, they will have silver flecks.<br> Finally, having no flecks is thought to represent no firekeeping talent, and is reserved for commoners. Of the common eye colors, a rare few are capable of displaying flecks, although the flecks aren’t highly visible unless shined upon or actively fluorescing.</p><h3 id="clothing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#clothing"><span>Clothing</span></a></h3><p>The general clothing style in Jïumannes is a unique blend of the styles of the eastern Tiangengzhe with the native Kaithurhi and Muintaferan, mainly in colors and patterns reminiscent of their Leaudoré colonizers. The separate cultures have highly distinct blends however, on account of all the clashing forces.<br> The Áren Küthjïeman of the south are notable for their unique cloak-poncho, the casul. It resembles a short poncho with a wide, deep neck to expose the Áren&#39;s rainward-covered napes and chests to the rain. Women are typically expected to obscure their chests with an undershirt, although many might prefer to forgo it, something considered slightly provocative.<br> The Áren are also known for their distaste for shoes, instead preferring to keep their spiked and rubberized feet bare. This serves them well, as their specialized feet are suited to taking hold of the slick tree roots and mud which form most of the solid ground in Arenfürich. For foreigners, the Áren manufacture special boots with soles made from the gum of a common plant.</p><h3 id="government" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#government"><span>Government</span></a></h3><p>The form of Jïumannes’s government is a union, composed of 6 states and 1 federal territory. Each state traces its founding back to one of the six council members of the Stormrunners, and the region as a whole is governed by a council of six elected representatives from each of the states. However, though the states cooperate heavily, it is frequently and hotly debated whether they act as a tight federation or a loose alliance.</p><h3 id="jiumannian-objectivism" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#jiumannian-objectivism"><span>Jïumannian Objectivism</span></a></h3><p>The Jïumannian belief system is founded on egoism and objectivism, specifically the principles that man should act in accordance with his best interest, and morality is a social construct used to put the good of society in man’s best interest. Morality is thus considered to be something easily debated and changed in accordance with what is required, almost being synonymous with law. The common tenets are:</p><ol><li><p>People will always act in their own best interest (homo economicus)</p></li><li><p>The only fair judge is a judge of multiple peers.</p></li><li><p>Morality is a social construct that must be agreed upon and enforced.</p></li><li><p>The best structure for society is one which ensures every individual stands to gain from the continued existence and growth of society.</p></li><li><p>The ability of the individual should be unchecked, and so too should be the ability of his peers to police him.</p></li><li><p>The proper purpose of life is the pursuit of one’s own happiness.</p><p>Moreover, a central tenet of Jïumannian philosophy is the unjust nature of privacy. Nothing is viewed as wrong enough to necessitate hiding from the public, and individuals are free to act however they wish so long as they are comfortable with being seen doing it. This laissez-faire approach to taboos is a common thread.</p><p>Naturally, this leads to an extremely individualistic governmental philosophy, while paradoxically being extremely authoritative. The individual&#39;s will and freedom are seldom controlled or limited by the government, because instead they are limited by the omniscient eye of the public.</p><p>This is not to say that Jïumannians are emotionally repressed, Jïumannian culture is extremely open and emotive, and being generous with information is viewed as amicable. Baths are public, doors are nonexistent, and one of the biggest taboos is allowing a secret to be discovered. To request to be alone with another is a heavily charged statement, that can be anything from a threat to an incredible display of trust and intimacy.</p></li></ol><h2 id="hynawyth-kaithurhi" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hynawyth-kaithurhi"><span>Hynawyth Kaithurhi</span></a></h2><h3 id="government-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#government-1"><span>Government</span></a></h3><p>The Kaithurhi lack any true overarching government, and are more anarchic than anything else. The one set of overarching rules, called the “Hinanndybiaeth Code,” is more of a moral expectation than recognized law. It forbids the existence of dependent relationships outside of families, only allowing for mutualistic relationships with no power imbalance.</p><p>This gives rise to a system wherein each “tribe” is less of a tribe than actual family units, called teipiau. These family units then enter into co-defense pacts with other units, in addition to other trade agreements. These interwoven relationships tend to group into large clusters, which are then called the tribes.</p><h3 id="philosophy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#philosophy"><span>Philosophy</span></a></h3><p>Much of the Kaithurhi’s beliefs are founded on Transcendentalist tenets, such as the importance of self-reliance and individuality and the innate goodness of man and nature. Notably, their culture is not based in individualism, which views all governance as harmful to the individual, but their government is often extremely weak and only protective.</p><p>In Kaithurhi tribes, families are expected to feed, clothe, and perform for themselves other essential services. These families then form into defensive pacts and alliances, which constitute the actual “tribes.” Codependent relationships, such as equal trade, where both parties would be worse off if one left, are neither frowned upon nor encouraged.</p><p>Metaphysically, the Kaithurhi see the Shadowless Dream and physical realm as part of the same dynamic process, as opposed to two separate locations. Namely, they believe them to be two separate states of mind that change one’s view of the world.</p><p>Finally, the Kaithurhi believe that all life is an expression of Emrall, each being containing a fractal piece of his infinite soul. Thus, all life is an individual expression of a piece of Emrall, and connected yet unique. To live by and for themselves and to be appreciative of the nature that surrounds them and the Emrall inside them, that is the philosophy of the Kaithurhi.</p>',32)])])}const l=a(o,[["render",s]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/encyclopedia/Anthropology/Culture.html","title":"Culture","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1761167674000,"contributors":[{"name":"Jycartha","username":"Jycartha","email":"jycartha@gmail.com","commits":4,"url":"https://github.com/Jycartha"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"f7ff0c8a723d04b9ccda24cc966fd700cb63c976","time":1761167674000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Navbar cleaning"},{"hash":"00d3d159e7c75c7a4324f3f8916a4c0fd8321274","time":1761083352000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Lots of updates"},{"hash":"9274cc5228954b4b4b827293d92ca1fdb002d57d","time":1761030095000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Fix images 2 (please)"},{"hash":"767e111c4c285daf74740a34af4e5269ee77112b","time":1761029185000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Home page and fixes"}]},"filePathRelative":"encyclopedia/Anthropology/Culture.md","excerpt":"\\n<h2>Ayangatal</h2>\\n<h3>The Stoneghost Doctrine</h3>\\n<p>Firekeeping within Ayangatal, and the greater area of Anndalor, is defined by the quasi-religious Stonehunter Order.
