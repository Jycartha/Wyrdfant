It borders Tereghda, Tuihorm, and Hynawyll, and has a majority coastline of both the Dreiamis Gulf and the Gedwolmis Gulf. Its capital is Raulhejärga, where the representatives of major city-states meet to discuss national policy and developments.</p><h3 id="gilded-heirs-highwalkers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gilded-heirs-highwalkers"><span>Gilded Heirs (Highwalkers)</span></a></h3><p>There exists a major distinction in the hierarchy of Arenfürich, dubbed by the general populace as the “Gilded Heirs.” The name describes the heirs of the 3 major families which control Arenfürich’s major statewide industries, and the most powerful seats on the council. The heirs are often very close to each other, as to encourage political unity they are raised like siblings, though this has been known to produce undesirable rivalries as well.</p><p>In terms of a political structure, the role of council overseer takes the form of a triumvirate between the three heirs, each having their own authoritative lineage and seat to pass down. The constitutional power of the overseer is locked behind a total agreement of the three powers, a restriction thought to guarantee rational compromises and justice by the Áren people. For this reason, many Áren consider their government to be somewhat more advanced than other forms of central authority.</p><p>Widely considered the “head” of the gilded heirs and the closest thing Arenfürich has to a ruling family, the Treöheira are the most powerful of the three lineages and control the highly lucrative rainwax industry. Especially dominant in the northwestern valleys, they also hold stakes in associated business like casul manufacturing and construction. Their most important alliance is with the Nakawürtas, who assist in shipping their products to eastern Halisan.</p><p>Perhaps the 2nd most powerful of the Golden Heirs are the Toracrufs, who maintain exclusive mining rights to the massive torhith deposits of the steamrise caves, highly valued by nobility almost globally for its unparalleled display of colors and brilliance. They maintain a similar deal with the Treöheiras and Nakawürtas, where the Toracrufs’ claim is protected by the Treöheira’s forces in exchange for offering them first pick and a significant discount.</p><p>The Nakawürtas are the last of the Gilded Heirs, and make their business in creating specialized boats capable of navigating the Réokea river, as well as in trading upon the river itself and within greater Jïumannes. This is somewhat helped by their agreement with the Treöheira, granting them monopolistic control over the river–enforced by the Treöheira’s armed forces–in exchange for buying slickwax exclusively from the Treöheira and supporting them in government.</p><h3 id="argent-heirs-raincatchers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#argent-heirs-raincatchers"><span>Argent Heirs (Raincatchers)</span></a></h3><p>Besides the upper 3 gilded heirs, there are also the lower 9 argent heirs, branch families of the gilded heirs which serve the triumvirate in positions including border control, peacekeeping, and naval operations.<br> The Huthleod are a prominent family of the argent heirs, a branch of the Nakawürta family that primarily maintains the navy, but also owns a large amount of seafaring businesses, and is the chief regulator of their affairs. They largely operate out of the Gedwolmis gulf, and though not as wealthy as the other families, still possess a treasury on scale with them.<br> Jëthwera is another name belonging to the argent heirs, yet is also known across Halisan for the quality of their tools, innovations, and most importantly, powderstaffs. If a powderstaff or set of shimmerplate doesn’t bear the Jëthwera brand, few Áren warriors will trust its quality. They supply mainly to the Huthleod and Aeldorfästen, but also to the larger armies of each heir and even the heirs themselves.<br> The Aeldorfästen are the lowest of the argent heirs, due to their position as operators of the various Arenfürich state fortresses and border guard. Their funds, however, are gained through foreign mercenary contracts and even a number of contracted soulforging monasteries. This vertical integration is a large part of their success, but has also put them on the radar of the more cautious families.</p>',10)])])}const l=a(s,[["render",h]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/encyclopedia/History/Nations%20_%20States/Arenf%C3%BCrich.html","title":"","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Arenfürich","slug":"arenfurich","link":"#arenfurich","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Gilded Heirs (Highwalkers)","slug":"gilded-heirs-highwalkers","link":"#gilded-heirs-highwalkers","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Argent Heirs (Raincatchers)","slug":"argent-heirs-raincatchers","link":"#argent-heirs-raincatchers","children":[]}]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1761083352000,"contributors":[{"name":"Jycartha","username":"Jycartha","email":"jycartha@gmail.com","commits":3,"url":"https://github.com/Jycartha"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"00d3d159e7c75c7a4324f3f8916a4c0fd8321274","time":1761083352000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Lots of updates"},{"hash":"9274cc5228954b4b4b827293d92ca1fdb002d57d","time":1761030095000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Fix images 2 (please)"},{"hash":"767e111c4c285daf74740a34af4e5269ee77112b","time":1761029185000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Home page and fixes"}]},"filePathRelative":"encyclopedia/History/Nations & States/Arenfürich.md","excerpt":"<h2>Arenfürich</h2>\\n<p>One of the native states of Jïumannes, it contains the entirety of the Arenfürich rainforest and the majority of the Áren people.
