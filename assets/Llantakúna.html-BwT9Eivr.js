Most usefully, the pigments can be genetically configured to either warm or cool by varying base amounts, as well as activated or deactivated spontaneously using acidity.</p><p>In practice, this means that the llantakúna are able to almost completely hide their aura at will, making them unnoticeable to wildlife and untrained sentients so long as they remain constant with the “background.” This does come at the cost of a temperature instability, loss of vision, and inability to breathe, but the effects can be managed and the skill trained.</p><p>The llantakúna also possess a number of minor traits to assist in this evolutionary strategy, including highly maneuverable fin-like ears and a sophisticated hearing system to match. This is due to the requirement of having shut, insulated eyes for the aura dulling to work (the eyes are a notorious shine-through point for sparks, given the lack of insulating bone between the brain and the outside world.)</p><p>With regards to phenotypes, the llantakúna have a wide range of colors and defining physical characteristics across their species. Their hair and eye colors run the gamut, while the color of their undertone is colored largely depending upon the temperature of their climate. Colder climates result in a pale inactivated tone, neutral leads to vibrant colors, and warmer results in darker hues.</p><p>The hue of activated skin, however, is entirely unique to the individual, with some cultures even considering the privilege of seeing it–and the flamescript-like patterns from the individual inscribed in it–to be quite intimate, and thus often go hunting with only a full-body, easily-removable cloak for coverage. Oddly, this also means they think less of nudity when the skin is inactivated.</p><h3 id="ayauitlaka" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ayauitlaka"><span>Ayauitlaka</span></a></h3><p>A race native to the mist-forests of Tohnipras, generally known for their large eyes, gray deactivated skin, iridescent activated skin, and small faces.<br> One of their major adaptations is their continually-shifting grayish skin, mimicking the natural pattern noise of the Tohnipras mist. They are also able to consciously control it, but are limited to grayscale shades. The patterns function as a sort of emotional indicator as well, in a similar manner to flamescript. For this effect, many other species see an ethereal beauty in the patterns, while fellow members of the species use them as secondary identifiers. For this reason, covering too much skin is viewed as taboo, not dissimilar to the Hythean sentiment towards sunglasses and eyes.</p><h3 id="yejian" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#yejian"><span>Yejian</span></a></h3><p>The Yejian are a people adapted to life on the rocky shores of the Janta strait, with low spark tolerance–supplied naturally by the waters– and high soulfire sensitivity, for detecting threats underwater. Unlike the other races of the llantakúna, they universally possess a blue hue to their activated skin, and seldom ever deactivate it. Their hair is also often either sapphire, jet black, or anywhere in between.</p><p>The Yejian are also capable of holding their breath for an extremely long time underwater, and possess a hearing system specially adapted for amphibious environments. They typically possess elongated arms, matched by a longer torso and a thin yet muscular body, all in service of a more able swimming form.</p><h3 id="ninanyawi" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ninanyawi"><span>Ninanyawi</span></a></h3><p>Native to the tropical rainforests and wetlands of southern Tohnipras, the Ninanyawi are well-adapted to warm climates with their pitch-colored undertone and warm-colored camouflaging hair. Due to their rainforest habitat’s demands for hunting, they have the best hearing of any known race, including their fellow llantakúna.</p><h3 id="nebvoltsi" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nebvoltsi"><span>Nebvoltsi</span></a></h3><p>An ancient race, named for their platinum blue hair, that inhabits the taigas and tundras of northern Tohnipras and Old Atleasia. They are the most soulfire sensitive race on Aliffrüme overall, possessing incredible sparksight and pyrrhoreceptors. Their excellent pyrrhoreceptors, like the schausen, were allowed by a lack of dense life to overload them.</p><p>Their sparksight, meanwhile, is to assist in hunting. Given the extreme cold of the taigas, most life makes use of heat-generating firekeeping bacteria (including the Nebvoltsi themselves), meaning that animal life is forced to give off a distinct spark glow. The nebvoltsi mask this glow–and keep warm–with an overabundance of body hair in a peculiar cerulean color. This color is derived from a copper-based porphyrin, which is able to absorb sparks and safely generate heat to keep warm.</p><p>This pigment is so saturated in their bodies it even shows through their skin and sclera, as it makes their blood to be bluish purple.</p><p>Similar to the Marmjogür, their skin and hair are pale, although tinged a platinum blue by their unique pigment. Unlike the Marmjogür, their sclera remain white, and they have a natural affinity for soulfire manipulation. Being able to conceal one’s sparks and efficiently generate heat on the tundras is an important evolutionary edge while rewarding firekeeping talent, and so many of the world’s elite [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] tend to be Nebvoltsi. Like many polar animals, they are also built large and strong to conserve heat, though the use of the copper uroporphyrin allows Nebvoltsi in particular to forgo the accruing of fat.</p>',18)])])}const h=a(s,[["render",r]]),c=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/encyclopedia/Natural%20Sciences/Biology/Sapient%20Species/Llantak%C3%BAna.html","title":"Llantakúna","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1761167674000,"contributors":[{"name":"Jycartha","username":"Jycartha","email":"jycartha@gmail.com","commits":4,"url":"https://github.com/Jycartha"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"f7ff0c8a723d04b9ccda24cc966fd700cb63c976","time":1761167674000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Navbar cleaning"},{"hash":"00d3d159e7c75c7a4324f3f8916a4c0fd8321274","time":1761083352000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Lots of updates"},{"hash":"9274cc5228954b4b4b827293d92ca1fdb002d57d","time":1761030095000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Fix images 2 (please)"},{"hash":"767e111c4c285daf74740a34af4e5269ee77112b","time":1761029185000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Home page and fixes"}]},"filePathRelative":"encyclopedia/Natural Sciences/Biology/Sapient Species/Llantakúna.md","excerpt":"\\n<p>As a species, the [[Glossary#^3687b2|Llantakúna]]'s main feature is their spark-utilizing undertone pigments, which can both dampen their presence by absorbing their sparks and help to passively regulate their temperature.
