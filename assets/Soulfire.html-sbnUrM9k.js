Thought causes changes in the soul plane, which in turn produces soulfire in reality. Born from consciousness, soulfire is an energy shaped by consciousness, and as such can be controlled after manifestation through intention fields to power actions in reality. It can only be summoned in large quantities by sapient creatures, but all life generates soulfire to some degree.</p><p>Soulfire production can also be an intentional process with the right training, but can just as easily run afoul of uncontrollable emotions. Any kind of cyclic, focused thought causes continuous, constant change in the plane’s curvature, generating much more curvature than quick thoughts or intentions. Additionally, the more the recurrent thought pertains to an accurate understanding of the self, the more the motion acts in harmony with the soul’s natural “angular momentum” or “shape” to produce stronger curvature, and thus more soulfire.</p><p>However, it’s also possible for spiraling, intensely emotional thoughts to generate power by this same principle. If, for example, an individual undergoes a traumatic experience and incessantly reprimands themself, this constitutes focused, cyclic thought. Furthermore, if the situation is dire enough, they may even begin to truly believe themselves, bending their own soul to fit the spin they generate, and subsequently lose themselves to becoming a Shade, the image of what they believe themselves to be.</p><p>Soulfire decay is also an observed phenomenon, and is responsible for the distinct lack of runaway generation that would occur without it. Because soulfire induces some standing curvature, and moving it necessarily involves changing curvature, any soulfire motion technically creates more soulfire. However, motion also generates conscious waves, which are observed to “unravel” soulfire back into the plain. In most combinations of speed and path, the decay wins out and soulfire loses strength the further it travels.</p><h3 id="soulfire-field" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#soulfire-field"><span>Soulfire Field</span></a></h3><p>A soulfire field is any conglomeration of uninfused soulfire, which floats around and through matter like a ghostly cloud, not interacting with any of the standard four fundamental forces. This follows naturally from the assumption that uninfused soulfire inhabits the conscious plane. These fields are also generated passively by all living things as a consequence (or prerequisite) of cognition, dubbed a “halo,” and can cause harm if too intensive. Some non-sapient species are capable of harnessing their halo with special chemicals to produce metabolic energy.</p><h3 id="sparks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sparks"><span>Sparks</span></a></h3><p>Sparks are the result of soulfire&#39;s loss of arbitrary precision when brought into quantized reality. It behaves similarly to electromagnetic radiation, and has the unique property of causing sentient beings to experience [[pixies]] when absorbed by their soul. Being able to interact with both soulfire and matter, it allows for both soulfire and soulfire constructs to be seen without intuitive senses, such as by machines and artifacts. It is also highly ionizing, and follows different rules for reflection than standard light.</p><h3 id="gimynfire" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gimynfire"><span>Gimynfire</span></a></h3><p>Soulfire produced by gimyndine; often “sharp,” discomforting, and somewhat repulsive.</p>',11)])])}const h=a(o,[["render",s]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/encyclopedia/Intuitive%20Phenomena%20_%20Theory/Pure%20Phlogistics/Soulfire.html","title":"Soulfire","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1761167674000,"contributors":[{"name":"Jycartha","username":"Jycartha","email":"jycartha@gmail.com","commits":4,"url":"https://github.com/Jycartha"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"f7ff0c8a723d04b9ccda24cc966fd700cb63c976","time":1761167674000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Navbar cleaning"},{"hash":"00d3d159e7c75c7a4324f3f8916a4c0fd8321274","time":1761083352000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Lots of updates"},{"hash":"9274cc5228954b4b4b827293d92ca1fdb002d57d","time":1761030095000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Fix images 2 (please)"},{"hash":"767e111c4c285daf74740a34af4e5269ee77112b","time":1761029185000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Home page and fixes"}]},"filePathRelative":"encyclopedia/Intuitive Phenomena & Theory/Pure Phlogistics/Soulfire.md","excerpt":"\\n<p>Also called alferhþ (lit. “Fire of the Ferhþ,” where “ferhþ” is a Küthjïuman-Halanian word meaning something between life, heart, and mind, commonly translated as “soul”), soulfire is an energy contained within the [[Conscious Plane]] to host the soul, passively loosed through thought.
