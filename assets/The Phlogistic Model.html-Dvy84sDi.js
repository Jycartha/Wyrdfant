Gimyns below this grade are unsuitable for little but carrying personal cargo unless mass resonance–a technique indigenous and restricted to the raincatcher Áren–is performed. Given the difficulty and danger of maintaining a resonant state, using singular stones for long periods of time is impractical. Combined with the rarity of purestones, this means that resonant [[firekeeping]] is rarely used for individual concerns, and is most often utilized in industry and national defense.</p><p>Blackfire devices are, though limited in scope and portability, relatively common, given how easy ashstone dust is to produce. This is how most machinery is powered within industrial centers, though it sees little use in rural areas given the dangers of contamination.</p><p>On the flip side, though [[Soulkeeping|soulkeeping]] is equally accessible to any and all, the practice requires intense discipline, self-reflection, and overall dedication to produce measurable results.
