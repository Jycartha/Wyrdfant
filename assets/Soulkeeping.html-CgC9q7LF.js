The technique is most common in the Kuthjïuman and Llantakúna, especially in farming castes such as the Kuthjïuman arteries or Llantakúna mistwalkers, but has been known to also occur in revolutionary figures in grandiose fashion.</p><h3 id="divine-arts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#divine-arts"><span>Divine Arts</span></a></h3><p>Divine Arts are a subset of soulkeeping which utilizes <strong>true engrams</strong>, which are those that become engraved upon the soul’s form over the course of life.</p><p>Unlike typical firekeeping, which requires deep concentration to form flamescript often prior to actual use, divine arts are much quicker and easier. The rather apparent downside is the difficulty of acquiring as significant a variety of effects as a compendium of scripted engrams might offer. However, given that true engrams are as familiar to the user as they get, they are thus highly efficient in regards to soulfire consumption.</p><p>Users of true engrams are called <strong>divine</strong>, and their arts as such, in large part from their theorized prevalent role in forming many idolic religions. Examination of historical records provides significant evidence that suggests many founding figures obtained their relatively tremendous power through true engrams, which to a script-less people appeared works of divinity.</p><h3 id="engraving" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#engraving"><span>Engraving</span></a></h3><p>The process of actually engraving a true engram is entirely subconscious, and highly dependent on deep-set personal interests, beliefs, and other traits. Often rather than choosing an engram, one’s own divine art will gradually develop and shape over time as they become more familiar with soulkeeping. For example, a phlogistician who spent their life studying soulfire’s interactions with spacetime might develop a divine art allowing them to directly manipulate it without forming the intricate flamescript.</p><p>In contrast to this gradual process, some arts are “gifted” after particularly memorable experiences, and are typically of some vague relation to the original memory. Note that “memorable” does not imply “traumatic,” as an equal number of arts have been gifted for making a sudden breakthrough in learning as for witnessing a shade’s slaughter. These arts in particular are often unexplainably exotic and anthropocentrically defined for their soulfire consumption, and are a point of frequent study in modern phlogistics.</p><h3 id="genetic-engrams-gengrams" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#genetic-engrams-gengrams"><span>Genetic Engrams (Gengrams)</span></a></h3><p>A form of inborn permanent engram inscribed into the soul and brain of a person, often with fantastical effects for their low soulfire cost. A majority of gengrams are inherited, a sort of resonance with the genetic engram of a divine ancestor. Assuming personalities (and subsequently phase sets) are genetic, it can be thought of like a similar composition causing an old pattern to rise to the surface.</p><h3 id="generation-arts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#generation-arts"><span>Generation Arts</span></a></h3><p>A consequence of soulfire’s ease of use within the body, a common method of simplistic ranged attack for soulkeepers is the generation and manipulation of blood. Although it is technically possible to use hair or another material, blood is the most versatile while being relatively cheap to regenerate through soul assertion. The arts are limited by the requirement that each stream connect back to the main body at all times, but they are nonetheless deadly in capable hands.</p><h3 id="blood-infusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#blood-infusion"><span>Blood Infusion</span></a></h3><p>The practice of engulfing objects in a prospective user&#39;s blood, granting the tool the ability to interact with soulfire, engrams, and shades. The technique is preferred by many keepers able to utilize soul assertion as a means of combustion delivery compared to direct infusion. Though it requires constant regeneration, many practitioners find the ease of infusing and maneuvering blood preferable to infusing a metallic weapon.</p><p>Objects coated with infused blood are also able to hold flamescript for a highly extended, near-indefinite duration. For this reason, individuals with true engrams that function well with weapons have an advantage over those who don&#39;t with regards to combat. They are also highly prized as potential scripters for custom weapons, though not many divine soulkeepers will so easily allow their engrams to be used due to their highly personal nature. Furthermore, divine engrams are notoriously difficult to comprehend by anyone other than their originator, with the task often considered sisyphean.</p>',17)])])}const l=a(s,[["render",o]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/encyclopedia/Intuitive%20Phenomena%20_%20Theory/Applied%20Phlogistics/Soulkeeping.html","title":"Soulkeeping","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1761167674000,"contributors":[{"name":"Jycartha","username":"Jycartha","email":"jycartha@gmail.com","commits":4,"url":"https://github.com/Jycartha"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"f7ff0c8a723d04b9ccda24cc966fd700cb63c976","time":1761167674000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Navbar cleaning"},{"hash":"00d3d159e7c75c7a4324f3f8916a4c0fd8321274","time":1761083352000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Lots of updates"},{"hash":"9274cc5228954b4b4b827293d92ca1fdb002d57d","time":1761030095000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Fix images 2 (please)"},{"hash":"767e111c4c285daf74740a34af4e5269ee77112b","time":1761029185000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Home page and fixes"}]},"filePathRelative":"encyclopedia/Intuitive Phenomena & Theory/Applied Phlogistics/Soulkeeping.md","excerpt":"\\n<h3>Synopsis</h3>\\n<p>Also known in stoneghost cultures as “savage flames,” or “devil’s breath,” soulkeeping is the practice of firekeeping while using one’s own soul as a source of intention.
