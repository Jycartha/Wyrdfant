The region is permanently under thick snow cover, though it is not devoid of life. The snow pulses with bioluminescent extremophile algae, which use fotivorous processes to melt the snow around them for water and photosynthesize. The algae maintain a constant supply of soulfire by living in large colonies, and secreting highly nutritious and sweet compounds like sucrose and glucose. This, combined with the promise of water, attracts other life to these “snow-springs” while encouraging them to keep the algae alive.</p>',6)])])}const h=a(n,[["render",s]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/encyclopedia/Geography/Biogeography.html","title":"Biogeography","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1761083352000,"contributors":[{"name":"Jycartha","username":"Jycartha","email":"jycartha@gmail.com","commits":3,"url":"https://github.com/Jycartha"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"00d3d159e7c75c7a4324f3f8916a4c0fd8321274","time":1761083352000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Lots of updates"},{"hash":"9274cc5228954b4b4b827293d92ca1fdb002d57d","time":1761030095000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Fix images 2 (please)"},{"hash":"767e111c4c285daf74740a34af4e5269ee77112b","time":1761029185000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Home page and fixes"}]},"filePathRelative":"encyclopedia/Geography/Biogeography.md","excerpt":"\\n<h2>Biomes</h2>\\n<h3>Copperleaf Forests</h3>\\n<p>A biome where gimyndine deposits have been brought up close to the surface, and into close proximity with dense life, typically tropical or temperate rainforests.
