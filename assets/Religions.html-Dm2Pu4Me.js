Instead, it centers around exalting the World and living as a part of it, taking part in its blessings, and maintaining its health for the generations to come. Under the religion’s teachings, the World is a living, semi-sentient system of sorts, which is to be respected and cared for as opposed to directly worshiped. However, the wandersoul Raul is venerated as a sort of manifestation of the World’s gifts back to its caretakers.<br> Although there is no organized worship, there are religious officials, referred to as Arteries–so named for the belief that soulfire is the “blood” of the World–whose duty is to transport blood from the Heart (conscious plane) to the Body (soil and plant life.) The Arteries organize the production and distribution of agricultural products from the Pulmonary Temples, directing the Capillaries in the harvesting and planting process, while the Arteries themselves nurture the plants.<br> That being said, there are various different kinds of Arteries, not just those who assist in agriculture. The large concentration of soulfire present in the Pulmonaries leads to the birth of Shades, which can sap the life from crops and harm the general populace. It is the duty of the Cleansers, another kind of Artery, to purge these creatures so that the harvest can remain plentiful and untainted.<br> Selection to be an Artery is dependent on one main factor: soulfire &quot;wattage.&quot; This is roughly dependent on the mass of living tissue on a person, though all tissue is not equal. A secondary qualification, necessary to be an Aortic (chief of a pulmonary), is extreme proficiency with the Divine Blood technique, and subsequently good control over soulfire itself.</p><h2 id="emrallism" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emrallism"><span>Emrallism</span></a></h2><p>A popular religion in Halisan that shares a common connector of Emrall, Verdant One as supreme patron, in the sense that he inspired a number of his powerful extraplanetary brethren to invest in Aliffrüme. Various sects then place emphasis on various disciples of Emrall, and the virtues they espouse. Their main holy text is the Lahrigus, structured into a preamble dictated by Emrall’s avatar on Earth, and then various volumes documenting the teachings of the disciples. The name of Emrall’s avatar varies by culture; where most Jïumannians refer to them as Halicsen of the Divine Scale, the Kaithurhi dub them Rhoddynbwyd-Segremyll-Emrallwih (Life-giver Segremyll, of Emrall), and the Muintaferan as Athagul, Father White.<br> After the preamble, the text continues with a section detailing the life and teachings of each disciple, written as a sort of 3rd-person autobiography. Each section is referred to as a Brüfeior in Halanian.</p><h3 id="sinathism" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sinathism"><span>Sinathism</span></a></h3><p>All is connected, all is tied. Good begets good, and evil begets evil. If none stop to give good in response to evil, when will the evil end? Thus to react on impulse is the highest evil, and the only reasonable voice in one’s head is the superego. The words of Brytho Sinath, Beastsoother.</p><h3 id="uthwitism" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#uthwitism"><span>Uthwitism</span></a></h3><p>What separates sentients from animals is knowledge, thus to gain knowledge is the most sentient act possible. Sentients lead animals because sentients know better for the animals than they could themselves. Therefore, society ought to be led by the most knowledgeable, and the chief pursuit of life is knowledge of the divine and all its creations. This was the doctrine laid out by Brytha Uthwita, Starscribe.</p><h3 id="etasedism" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#etasedism"><span>Etasedism</span></a></h3><p>Life is emotion, creation, and expansion. The chief pursuit of life is emotional experience, the dividing line between man and beast. Emotion inspires creation, creations inspire similar emotions in others. The best emotion will naturally win out, and the final emotion will logically be the best one that could be. Naturally, many tenets are shared with hedonism, but all are preached by Brytho Etasedon, Allfeeling.</p><h3 id="ascwenism" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ascwenism"><span>Ascwenism</span></a></h3><p>To live is to serve and be served, to exist in the natural hierarchy. Every man and woman was born with a predetermined fate, and to discover and ensure this fate is the most noble pursuit of life. Naturally, to act against one’s Fate is considered a grave sin, and going against another’s is only acceptable if one’s own requires it. Such were the teachings of Brytha Ascwen, Autumnal Queen.</p><h3 id="munyerism" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#munyerism"><span>Munyerism</span></a></h3><p>To work the land and provide for the community is the highest calling of those who follow the tenets of Munyerism, the sect of Emrallism venerating Brytho Munyether, Great Cultivator. Munyether, it is said, was responsible for taming the tempests of Freatéfor and instilling a wandersoul of life into Ysthréorh valley and granting it eternal fertility. Thus Brytho Munyether, Landfather, gave unto the people.</p><h3 id="gwilism" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gwilism"><span>Gwilism</span></a></h3><p>Competition is the bread and butter of Gwilism, a sect of Emrallism which places emphasis on Brytho Gwilystor, Night-tamer as the one who tamed the northwest’s infamous fealstor grimewolves. Life’s goal is to immolate you, and yours is to purify yourself in the holy flames. Only the strongest shall prevail, and only the virtuous deserve to.</p><h3 id="bwyddism" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bwyddism"><span>Bwyddism</span></a></h3><p>A sect that believes in Rhoddynbwyd-Segrewyll-Emrallwih as a life-angel servant of Emrall, and the one who sacrificed his energy to give life to the Kanthyna. This necessarily believes that the gimyndine statue, with hands outstretched and a gaze towards the rising suns, is Rhoddyn-Bwyd’s body.</p><h3 id="regnbranism" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#regnbranism"><span>Regnbranism</span></a></h3><p>All on Earth is transcience, except transience itself. Life is like a flowing river: each drop of water is not long for the journey, but the river remains. The meaning of life is to follow the flow and not obstruct the river as it flows towards the end, but to enjoy the journey and its turbulence. From the words of Brytha Regnbran, Rainbringer.</p><h3 id="tshaighcruism" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tshaighcruism"><span>Tshaighcrúism</span></a></h3><p>A sect that venerates Tshaicrú Newvaful, Father Crimson as the shaper of the bloodgrass plains, guardian of the Muintaferan, and gracious benefactor to all who dedicate their lives to justice. A rare sight in Jïumannian culture, the religion venerates fatherhood as the most noble pursuit in life, above even rulers and rainbreakers.</p>',27)])])}const l=a(s,[["render",o]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/encyclopedia/Anthropology/Religions.html","title":"Religions","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1761083352000,"contributors":[{"name":"Jycartha","username":"Jycartha","email":"jycartha@gmail.com","commits":3,"url":"https://github.com/Jycartha"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"00d3d159e7c75c7a4324f3f8916a4c0fd8321274","time":1761083352000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Lots of updates"},{"hash":"9274cc5228954b4b4b827293d92ca1fdb002d57d","time":1761030095000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Fix images 2 (please)"},{"hash":"767e111c4c285daf74740a34af4e5269ee77112b","time":1761029185000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Home page and fixes"}]},"filePathRelative":"encyclopedia/Anthropology/Religions.md","excerpt":"\\n<h2>Rusacáveism</h2>\\n<p>The dominant religion of Monêfor, and the originator of the Stoneghost Doctrine.
