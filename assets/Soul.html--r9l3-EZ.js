When standing curvature passes a certain limit, noise effects become negligible and the constituent phases begin self-stimulating and entering feedback loops with each other. This runaway process results in a curvature singularity, which promptly rebounds into a new, separate conscious plane composed of the phase set, generally reaching hydrostatic equilibrium with the wider plane’s phlogistic pressure in the shape of the body.</p><p>The soul is further situated within a region of conscious space called the <em><strong>halo</strong></em>, which has its boundary where foreign soulfire holds the soul’s own in equilibrium with external phlogistic pressure. The movements and vibrations of the soul result in halo soulfire being squashed and stretched, and correspond to the notion of thought and emotion. From this, the model thus posits the conscious soul to be the ultimate center of consciousness, and the seat of the common idea of “the self.”</p><p>Given the theory that the soul and conscious plane are the source of cognition and choice, it is prudent to clarify the role of the brain in such a model. While the soul hosts what may well be called the psyche and will, the brain acts like an interface and microcontroller for the body. Under this model, the brain can be treated like a sensory organ for the soul, something which presents information about the material plane to the soul, then interprets and enacts the soul’s whims within it.</p><p>But how does the soul communicate with the material plane? It is currently believed that thought necessitates movement in the soul, necessarily causing internal soulfire collisions. This in turn shunts small amounts of soulfire down to communicate the soul’s intentions to the brain, which processes this information into movement and other voluntary functions, while automatically handling involuntary functions.</p><p>However, the brain must also communicate with the soul, in order to relay sensory information and recollections. It’s believed that the soul is able to obtain this information from miniature combustions of infused soulfire in the brain. The specific theory is that if conscious wave sources generate soulfire, annihilating soulfire should generate conscious waves as well. This is based on the observation that combustion can be “heard” through pyrrhoreception.</p><p>Many scholars debate which exact pieces of the conscious experience the soul and brain are each responsible for. The brain is believed to be the host of short-term memory, while the soul engraves certain long term memories and experiences. The soul handles decision making after gathering processed sensory information from the brain.</p><p>The soul is also capable of affecting change within the exterior conscious plane according to a propagation limit. Within the noise, any phase is mostly unable to distinguish itself from the others and thus acts normally, randomly, resulting in close to net zero curvature. A soul creates a region of self-determination, from which information and force can propagate out at light speed, with force losing intensity by an inverse square law.</p><h3 id="refinement" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#refinement"><span>Refinement</span></a></h3><p>Despite the generally positive connotation of the term “refinement,” in phlogistics it serves as a catch-all term for reformations of the soul. This includes the original process named as such, the reforging of postnatal fireborn, and the corruption of shades.</p><p>The original process, which gave the category its name, involves maintaining a sufficiently high soulfire production state with significant alignment for some length of time. If successful, and often accidental, the spinning soulfire will reach a critical point before collapsing down onto the soul, perfectly merging with it and granting the soul a higher “density.” This results in future movements of the soul inducing more curvature, thus allowing for stronger generation and manipulation. However, it also allows for the same production to be achieved with less movement, thus making previous tasks more efficient.</p><p>Refinement also occurs during the process of postnatal firebirth, where an individual undergoes an extreme realization or pattern of thought, resulting in a tremendous volume of soulfire crashing down into their soul plane at once, often initiating a second soul genesis. This reconstructs the soul plane from the ground up, and often the body along with it given the intensity of the phlogistic forces involved. What results in a body and soul more closely aligned with the thoughts that caused the rebirth, often accompanied by a denser and stronger soul plane.</p><p>Though decidedly negative, refinement is also the process responsible for the formation and appearance of shades. The chief difference, and a recent discovery with the use of improved pyrrhosensory engrams, is the direction of the soulfire. Rather than in alignment with the soul’s inertia, the soulfire spins with such intensity in an opposing direction, that the soul is bent into conformity until it aligns with the rotation and <em>then</em> combines, often trapping the victim in the monstrous form they imagined.</p><h3 id="souls-and-death" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#souls-and-death"><span>Souls and Death</span></a></h3><p>A soul, herein defined as a spatially distinct embedded 3-manifold within the conscious plane, permanently encodes what can be defined as a consciousness. The creation of a soul occurs when an impression in the conscious plane undergoes harmonization to the point where a conscious skin forms, eliminating outside noise and allowing the remaining harmonic to self-interfere and recognize itself, driving an exponential process that culminates in its severing from the conscious plane, creating its own embedded region.</p><p>The mechanics of death depend upon the refinement of the dying. If there remains a naked soul, its power draws it towards the Greater Conscious Field. If the soul retains too much attachment to its world, it will instead remain drifting in the conscious plane as a wandersoul.</p><p>If a being who did not come into possession of a soul dies, the process goes as follows: Once “brain death” takes place, the impression slowly returns to being indistinguishable from the conscious noise.</p><h3 id="space-density" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#space-density"><span>Space Density</span></a></h3><p>Uniformity of space density is not a given when transitioning between conscious planes. In fact, most souls, in comparison to the greater conscious plane, are much denser due to their high engrammatic mass. Necessarily, crossing this boundary appropriately stretches or squishes whatever does so. It</p><h3 id="wandersouls" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wandersouls"><span>Wandersouls</span></a></h3><p>Wandersouls are created by the mass recognition of some personification, tiny amounts of soulfire unconsciously donated to form an engrammatic mass in imitation of a soul. They can be benevolent, a notable example being the Lord of the Everstorm, the guardian spirit of Arenfürich. However, wandersouls can also be created from rumors or monster tales, and they will act accordingly.</p><p>Wandersouls vary wildly in power, size, and visibility, according to the number and nature of their believers. Often “imaginary friends” are very real, but since only one being believes in their existence, they are nearly invisible and are limited only to spectating or perhaps speaking through conscious vibrations.</p><p>A list of known wandersouls and their locations, descriptions, powerbase, abilities, and behavior is as follows:</p><ul><li>“Lord of the Everstorm, Raul” <ul><li>Location: Raulhejëarga Basin, Arenfürich</li><li>Description: A country-scale wandersoul responsible for Arenfürich’s highly increased frequency of rain, and its strange mineral content.</li><li>Powers: The manipulation of water and especially rain</li><li>Behavior: Non-sentient, ambivalent. Very machine-like, it merely seeks to maintain the patterns of rain.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="worldbound-soul" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#worldbound-soul"><span>Worldbound Soul</span></a></h3><p>A curious subset of wandersouls formed when a transcendent soul is rejected, binding them to the place of their transcendence as a wandersoul unreliant on extraneous soulfire to persist. Given that they used to be transcendent, they remain able to generate and control a massive amount of soulfire. However, since they no longer possess a corporeal form, they are unable to use coupling.</p>',26)])])}const l=t(s,[["render",a]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/encyclopedia/Intuitive%20Phenomena%20_%20Theory/Pure%20Phlogistics/Soul.html","title":"Soul","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1761167674000,"contributors":[{"name":"Jycartha","username":"Jycartha","email":"jycartha@gmail.com","commits":4,"url":"https://github.com/Jycartha"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"f7ff0c8a723d04b9ccda24cc966fd700cb63c976","time":1761167674000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Navbar cleaning"},{"hash":"00d3d159e7c75c7a4324f3f8916a4c0fd8321274","time":1761083352000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Lots of updates"},{"hash":"9274cc5228954b4b4b827293d92ca1fdb002d57d","time":1761030095000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Fix images 2 (please)"},{"hash":"767e111c4c285daf74740a34af4e5269ee77112b","time":1761029185000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Home page and fixes"}]},"filePathRelative":"encyclopedia/Intuitive Phenomena & Theory/Pure Phlogistics/Soul.md","excerpt":"\\n<p>Under the Phlogistic Model, the soul is a separate region of the conscious plane roughly overlapping the body.
