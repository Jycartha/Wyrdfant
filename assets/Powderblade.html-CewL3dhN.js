Instead, they serve as a countermeasure to heavyweight scriptlighters and their high-flashpoint armor. When coupled armor is struck with a powderblade, there is naturally a combustion event, resulting in the decoupling of the blade and the draining of the armor’s coupling charge. However, the pure-crystal carbon structure of the powderblade is easily re-coupled and reformed, whereas the high-resistance armor would require full focus to recharge.
