Their most stand-out feature is their rainwards, organs that cover their limbs and other parts of the body, taking in the hard rainwater and converting it to a rough, guarded, natural armor. Their ears have been similarly hardened into horns, bioluminescent at the tips to prevent losing members under the waters, which also glow brighter in the presence of sparks as an early-warning sign. Aside from that, their traits are mostly internal, including largely reworked muscular, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems to account for a large size and larger calorie intake.</p><p>A notable consequence of Halanian&#39;s lack of contact with gimyndine is much stronger cases of glassröt, and a great difficulty in resonating with it. This has changed in modern times with the arrival of trade with gimyndine-using races, but is still a disadvantage. The flip of this, of course, means that the strongest luciants to be found are Halanian, helped along by their strong systems.</p><h3 id="aren" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aren"><span>Áren</span></a></h3><p>%%Instead of producing an oil, Kuthjïuman rainwards are simply areas of reptilian-like scales which act to prevent the person from drying out or suffering water damage. This gives a natural reason for it to cover their legs, lower arms, upper torso and back.%%</p><p>A Kuthjïuman native to the Arenfürich rainforest, which focuses on the growth of completely water-inundated crops. They are notably taller than their genetic relatives, with the average male standing at 6’ 10” and 250 pounds, while the average female sits at 6&#39; 6” and 210 pounds. Despite this, perhaps their most important adaptations are their specialized sweat glands which produce a hydrophobic oil, along with their powerful frames necessary for supporting and supplying blood to their titanic heights.</p><p>Due to Arenfürich being in a state of perpetual rainfall–save for the twice-annual &quot;dry season&quot; of snowfall–any sort of fur or hair which might retain water is a liability. Therefore, the Áren are hairless everywhere except for their scalp, which was retained for both sexual selection and spark shielding for the brain. But since protection against sparks is still necessary everywhere else, their skin is oddly smooth and slimy, with a rubbery white or black material—called rainward—covering rarely-stretched skin and utilizing the everstorm’s rainwater to produce a hydrophobic oil. It covers their hook-like strong feet as well, granting them a unique mobility on the water-slicked tree roots and swamp floors of Arenfürich.</p><p>Like the other Halanian natives, their ears are made of hardened chitin and form part of a large horn structure, which varies in appearance between men and women.</p><p>This is part of a larger trend of sexual dimorphism in the Áren. Rainward growths on Áren women focus more on the arms to leave the chest mostly bare, have a rounded shape, and are grayish in color. Growths on men are centered around the torso while still covering the arms, have jagged branching horns, and take on a dark black hue.</p><h3 id="kaithurhi" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#kaithurhi"><span>Kaithurhi</span></a></h3><p>A sub-species of the Áren highly adapted for life in the copperleaf forests, with extremely high defenses against disharmonic soulfire and an innate inability to use gimyndine. However, it is to be noted that they cannot produce significant amounts of soulfire on their own, and instead rely on resonant <em>Animarchaea</em> and ambient soulfire.</p><p>To protect their soulfire-sensing organs, which are still necessary even in the high-soulfire environment of the copperleaf forest, they are encased within black knife-like upwards-facing horns with red sensing edges on the men, while on women they face downwards and curve like karambits, with blue sensing edges.</p><p>They have lots of delphinidin and cyanidin hues, predominantly cyan, with tan skin. A light blue-purple shimmer is also present all over their skin and hair. Their hair skin-shimmer color is also heavily dependent on their diet, with the most important being the regular consumption of Sancffrwyth, a pure white berry with a pale cyan halo.</p><p>There is also a notable mutation in the Kaithurhi, where the skin is turned white and acquired hair and eyes shades are pink and yellow. Kaithurhi possessing this trait are called Rosithurhi, and are revered as once-a-generation soul-mediums and leaders. They always possess red, exceptionally long, upwards horns.</p><p>Of note is the Kaithurhi&#39;s distinct lack of spark sensors, due to all life in copperleaf forests simply using the already-material ambient soulfire. This also lends them to having incredible pyrrhoreceptors, however, since many more threats can harness soulfire.</p><h3 id="muintaferan" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#muintaferan"><span>Muintaferan</span></a></h3><p>A species closely related to the Kaithurhi, who live mostly on the bloodgrass plains just south of Kanthyna and the Hynawyll valley. They possess extremely dark skin, deer-like scarlet antlers, and almost homogeneously possess scarlet hair and eyes. Their ears are rounded and devoid of pyrrhoreceptors, something extremely rare in Aliffrüme and only shared with the Kaithurhi. Their hair and antlers help them to camouflage among the bloodgrass, resembling standing blades.</p><p>Due to their grassland environment, they evolved rather long and powerful legs, which grants them a rather tall average height. In addition to their excellent stamina, this makes them well suited to long bouts of running. This lends itself to chasing down the agile prey on the plains, and makes a greater portion of their height compressible for hiding in the bloodgrass. Other species do believe it to look rather strange, however.</p><p>They are known to most other races in the form of Cruín, Muintaferan who choose to dedicate their lives to assisting the good and kind. Although most are taught to respect the Cruín, some competitively-minded foreigners often capture the Muintaferan for sale into slavery. Not that the Jïumannians treat them much better, even if the populations outside the valley can flourish in modern gimyndized society.</p>',19)])])}const l=a(n,[["render",s]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/encyclopedia/Natural%20Sciences/Biology/Sapient%20Species/Kuthj%C3%AFuman.html","title":"","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Kuthjïuman","slug":"kuthjiuman","link":"#kuthjiuman","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Áren","slug":"aren","link":"#aren","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Kaithurhi","slug":"kaithurhi","link":"#kaithurhi","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Muintaferan","slug":"muintaferan","link":"#muintaferan","children":[]}]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1761029185000,"contributors":[{"name":"Jycartha","username":"Jycartha","email":"jycartha@gmail.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/Jycartha"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"767e111c4c285daf74740a34af4e5269ee77112b","time":1761029185000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Home page and fixes"}]},"filePathRelative":"encyclopedia/Natural Sciences/Biology/Sapient Species/Kuthjïuman.md","excerpt":"<h2>Kuthjïuman</h2>\\n<p>A Halanian species, the [[Glossary#^69f8b6|Kuthjïuman]] have their origins in the superfarms that inhabited the continent in the Hythean era, and as such have a number of key features to assist in that role.
