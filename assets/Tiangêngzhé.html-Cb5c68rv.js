Due to their ancestral heritage being in the natural gimyndine asteroid mines surrounding Aliffrume, they also possess sharp intuitive vision and sensitive EM vision, which affords them an easier time in spotting prey amidst the jungle.</p><h3 id="altakhu" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#altakhu"><span>Altakhu</span></a></h3><p>A prevalent race that inhabits Anndalor, with very high soulfire sensitivity, to the point where some altakhu have been known to become “ascendant,” surviving solely off of their own soulfire and never aging. Warm-skinned and warm-haired, they also possess enlarged pyrrhoreceptors in their ears, which grants them exceedingly long ears, even by Aliffrüme standards. These traits suggest a position among the technicians of the higher satellites, lithe frames and sensitive pyrrhoreception making them ideal circuit jockeys to patrol the underbelly.</p><p>Notably, many altakhu possess a strange adaptation to their typical habitat of the Thundering Hills. Because of both the native grass and the Altakhu’s skin being highly insulative, a high amount of static electricity often builds up on their skin. This is amplified and further controlled by a unique soulfire organ, granting the Altakhu a natural control over electricity. Essentially, they have taser limbs.</p><p>Finally, the altakhu have a notable physical distinction in their hair, caused by the cyclical acid-purging of their main grain. Hair grown during the acidic cycle will be more acidic-hued, and vice versa, leading to bands of color in whatever strands have grown long enough.</p><h3 id="leaudore" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#leaudore"><span>Leaudoré</span></a></h3><p>Thought to have served in the kitchens of the upper orbits, the Leaudoré have modified skin glands that produce a potent anesthetic and antibacterial oil, which the Hytheans were able to safely metabolize like capsaicin.
