The creatures resemble a kind of gargantuan mer-wolf, and are harvested for their large hauls of high-quality [[Gimyndine]] and other useful materials, forming the backbone of the [[Llantakúna#Yejian|Yejian]] economy and power system.</p><p>Naturally, the creatures vary in size and behavior, with the largest being capable of threatening cities. But as the size rises, so too does the haul, and thus many Yejian [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] have made a career around hunting the creatures and innovating novel techniques such as the rolling couple to help conquer water and, by extension, the creatures.</p><h3 id="shimmer-beasts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shimmer-beasts"><span>Shimmer-beasts</span></a></h3><p>The name for a large group of predators native to copperleaf forests, which are capable of harnessing ambient [[Soulfire]] for their own [[Engram|engrams]], and which typically possesses a [[Flamescript]]-like intuitive iridescence, from which they get their name. They are the only natural predators of the [[Kuthjïuman#Kaithurhi|Kaithurhi]], and are very difficult to defeat without adequate preparation.</p><h3 id="armored-branchlight" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#armored-branchlight"><span>Armored Branchlight</span></a></h3><p>One of the iconic species native to the [[Halisan#Arenfürich|Arenfürich]] rainforest, it resembles a stark gray tree pangolin with gold vertical stripes all along its body. They are relatively large to be able to generate sufficient body heat, around 20 inches from head to body with a further 28 inches of tail. Their claws and undertail are covered in a white rubbery material similar to [[Kuthjïuman#Áren|Áren]] rainward, which allows them excellent grip even on the wet bark of the canopy.</p><p>Their diet consists chiefly of slickwood mites, a hive insect that make their homes in hollowed out [[Plant Species#Slickwood Tree|slickwood trees]]. They clean the trees of these pests, and in return the trees retain one or two empty branches for the creatures to hang from.</p><p>Their native habitat thus lies among the bulbs of the slickwood tree. When not hunting, they will hang from an empty branch and roll themselves into a ball and use firekeeping to have their stripes glow, camouflaging themselves as one of the glowing amber orbs.</p><h3 id="canopy-longnose" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#canopy-longnose"><span>Canopy Longnose</span></a></h3><p>The main pollinator of [[Halisan#Arenfürich|Arenfürich]], they resemble lemurs with exceptionally long noses suited to nectar-hunting, and long rainward tails suited to grasping wet branches. Various species cater to the various flowering trees of the rainforest, dashing among the upper canopy with the aid of powerful legs and a light frame. For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as skippers. Some common species include the wine-back, the redcoat, and the gold-glow.</p><p>One especially common species of longnose is the feathered longnose, known for the waterproof sheen of its dark feathers. Some time ago, the áren nobility were able to domesticate and breed the species to possess beautiful streaks of bright red, blue, magenta, cyan, violet, and gold. It is one of the more common pets for a noblewoman, favored for its restrained beauty with streaks of enticing emotion and vibrancy.</p><h3 id="domestic-rivertail" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#domestic-rivertail"><span>Domestic Rivertail</span></a></h3><p>A large lizard-like reptilian species originally domesticated as fishing partners in [[Halisan#Arenfürich|Arenfürich]], they have since been bred into many different variants. Most warrior&#39;s breeds range around the height of large dogs, about 3.5 feet in height and 6 feet from head to hind, with 4 feet of tail. They tend to be colored deep brown and red, the latter being bred as the color of valor.</p><p>Ornamental breeds are much smaller, being under a foot off the ground with 1 foot of body and 1 foot of tail, but possess vibrant colors and various exaggerated features. These are favored by non-combat noblemen, advertising their compassion through the breed&#39;s unique playfulness, in addition to guarding against pickpockets and being a nice shoulder piece.</p><h3 id="lowland-plateback" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lowland-plateback"><span>Lowland Plateback</span></a></h3><p>A large amphibious reptile resembling a mix between a whale shark and turtle, which uses its large size to sit comfortably in the rivers of [[Halisan#Arenfürich|Arenfürich]], breathing through a hole on the top of its shell and filter feeding the abundant cyanobacteria and algae.</p><h3 id="swarmswatch" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#swarmswatch"><span>Swarmswatch</span></a></h3><p>A small, camouflaging, reptilian pollinator.
