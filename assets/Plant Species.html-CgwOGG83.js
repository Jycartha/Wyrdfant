It serves as the [[Gimyndine]] purifier for the ecosystem, housing a varied ecology of pneumivorous bacteria and an expansive rhizome root system.

It is used widely in the art of intuitive storytelling practiced by the native [[Llantakúna#Nebvoltsi|Nebvoltsi]] and [[Llantakúna#Ayauitlaka|Ayauitlaka]], and remains a major export to foreign [[Firekeeper|firekeepers]] without [[Kindlegem|kindlegems]] or having traditional tastes.</p><h3 id="pelygwyr" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pelygwyr"><span>Pelygwyr</span></a></h3><p>A rare flowering vine native to the Kanthyna forest, noted for its emerald green petals and the glowing gold patterns upon them. It is regarded as a holy flower by the tribes of the Eldwyth, a gift that breathes life into the forest with its light.</p><p>It is known to grow on and around outcroppings of gimyndine, absorbing and metabolizing all the discordant soulfire and sparks and emitting a pure golden-white soulfire. This golden soulfire is what all the fotivorous flora of the forest feed on, and what the firekeeping fauna utilize for their engrams. Therefore, the health of the Pelygwyr population is central to the health of the entire forest.</p><p>The main pigment used in the process is turacoverdin, but the foundations of the process are present in numerous species of the <em><strong>dissoarchaea</strong></em> genus. These algae each absorb a differing spectrum of the gimyndine’s soulfire individually, use a little of its energy, then re-emit it with a wavelength proportionally shortened. As each cell removes less and less energy, the soulfire is eventually fully harmonized and purified. With no further energy extractable by the <em><strong>dissoarchaea</strong></em> it escapes through dedicated openings (the pattern) as a golden-white glow.</p><h3 id="ringroot" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ringroot"><span>Ringroot</span></a></h3><p>A rhizomal vine native to Arenfürich which grows extremely thick shoots in circling patterns, forming natural circular enclosures which gather rainwater into areas of standing water suitable for plant growth. When the plants die, they sink to the bottom and form nutrient-rich soil for the ringroot. The various forms of ringroot are cultivated by the Áren as natural crop containers, and their fruits are sometimes eaten in times of famine.</p><h3 id="slickwood-tree" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#slickwood-tree"><span>Slickwood Tree</span></a></h3><p>A towering lamptree native to Arenfürich that inhabits the rainier areas, where other trees would erode or lack root systems. The tree is known for producing an extremely hydrophobic epicuticular wax all along the bark and leaves, especially its upper leaves, to guard against the heavy rain. The native Àren cultivate the tree for this wax, which is used in the making of many of their products and sells for a high price in foreign lands. The wax itself is valued for its ability to be easily mixed in with a wood finish, polish, and even some oil-based dyes, all while retaining its properties.</p><p>The size and thickness of each tree is immense, even by rainforest standards. The trees can grow as tall as 120 feet, with trunks as thick as 10 feet. The thickness is necessary to store sufficient sap for the Arenfürich winters, where all rainfall ceases for 10 weeks. The roots can grow as thick as 12 feet in places, while sprawling out as far as 100 feet. Uniquely, the roots grow halfway above ground perpendicular to the local water flow so as to build up piles of sediment for feeding.</p><p>Given the protective nature of these large trees, many plants and animals flourish under their canopy. Various vines, mosses, and lichens make root on their trunks, and the pollinating longnose lemurs enjoy eating the nourishing nectar from the slickwood bellflowers.</p><h3 id="animarchaea-genus" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#animarchaea-genus"><span>Animarchaea (Genus)</span></a></h3><p>A genus of fotivorous prokaryotes that harvest energy from harmonic soulfire through the use of various porphyrin-based pigments. These species are found almost exclusively in the rivers of Hynawyll Valley, with certain species becoming dominant in each of the 9-dyed Rivers, which truly number 6. The species inhabiting the lower 6 (fork) rivers, <em><strong>coccineum</strong></em>, <em><strong>aurantineum</strong></em>, <em><strong>flauvineum</strong></em>, <em><strong>prasineum</strong></em>, <em><strong>cayaneum</strong></em>, and <em><strong>caeruelineum</strong></em> glow the “lower” colors of Eldwyn culture. These form pairs into the 3 higher (combined) rivers, which host <em><strong>violaneum</strong></em>, <em><strong>roseneum</strong></em>, and <em><strong>vinineum</strong></em>; the 3 “holy colors” of the Eldywth tribes. These all finally combine into the 10th Holy River, which hosts innumerable species and glows an ethereal white.</p><p>These species use the energy harvested to do many things, but the primary two are to power a proton pump and to generate a defensive barrier; the barrier being necessary for maintaining cellular structure without undergoing lysis in the intense environment. The bacteria are also able to subtly adjust their barriers and soulfire absorption spectra to harmonize with each other or other life. This can lead to large blooms in soulfire rivers, and is also utilized in the Kaithurhi’s symbiotic relationship with certain species.</p>',17)])])}const l=a(o,[["render",n]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/encyclopedia/Natural%20Sciences/Biology/Plant%20Species.html","title":"Plant Species","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1761167674000,"contributors":[{"name":"Jycartha","username":"Jycartha","email":"jycartha@gmail.com","commits":4,"url":"https://github.com/Jycartha"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"f7ff0c8a723d04b9ccda24cc966fd700cb63c976","time":1761167674000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Navbar cleaning"},{"hash":"00d3d159e7c75c7a4324f3f8916a4c0fd8321274","time":1761083352000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Lots of updates"},{"hash":"9274cc5228954b4b4b827293d92ca1fdb002d57d","time":1761030095000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Fix images 2 (please)"},{"hash":"767e111c4c285daf74740a34af4e5269ee77112b","time":1761029185000,"email":"jycartha@gmail.com","author":"Jycartha","message":"Home page and fixes"}]},"filePathRelative":"encyclopedia/Natural Sciences/Biology/Plant Species.md","excerpt":"\\n<h3>Goldwood</h3>\\n<p>A semi-uncommon flowering tree native to the copperleaf forests around the Assurian Crater.
